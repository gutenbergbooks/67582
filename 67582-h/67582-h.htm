<h2 class="main">JERRY TODD SAYS:</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">What you will particularly like about this book, I believe, is our money-making canal-boat
show. We fixed up Dad’s old clay scow swell, with a stage and audience seats and everything.
We even had a sort of “orchestra.” Oh, boy! The way that old merry-go-round hand organ
gurgled out its tunes when we twisted its tail! And the fun we had!
</p>
<p>Scoop was the magician, advertised in the Tutter newspaper as the Great Kermann. Red
was the ticket agent. Peg and I were officers of the show company and stage hands.
</p>
<p>It was plain to us that we were going to make a wad of money giving black art shows.
A million dollars, Scoop said, in fun. Peg said steadily that <i>he</i> would be satisfied with the price of a new bicycle. He got the bicycle, all right.
But when you have read this story of fun and money-making and hidden mystery to its
exciting final climax, you will say that he earned what he got … all of us, for that
matter.
</p>
<p>There is a new kind of ghost in this story. The Stricker gang, our enemy, tried jealously
to <span class="pageNum" id="pb.vi">[<a href="#pb.vi">vi</a>]</span>break up our show, but the “friendly ghost” helped us out. Was it a real ghost? Or
was it some unknown man playing ghost? <i>We</i> didn’t know.
</p>
<p>Buried treasure, a lonely island, alternately cloaked in the blackest darkness and
the brightest moonlight, a mysterious piano leg, a crazy-acting, talkative piano tuner—these
are a few of the unusual high lights in an adventure story more exciting, I think,
than my two earlier books, JERRY TODD AND THE WHISPERING MUMMY (Book No. 1) and JERRY
TODD AND THE ROSE-COLORED CAT (Book No. 2); and as mysteriously bewildering as my
later books, JERRY TODD AND THE WALTZING HEN (Book No. 4) and <a class="pglink xd31e44" title="Link to Project Gutenberg ebook" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/67564">JERRY TODD AND THE TALKING FROG</a> (Book No. 5).
</p>
<p>Having read this story, treat yourself to some more hilarious fun with the “Whispering
Mummy” book, a detective story that probably a million boys have laughed over. Mummy
itch! Ever have it? <i>We</i> did.
</p>
<p>In my “Rose-colored Cat” book we have our trials with a “feline rest farm”—a sort
of sanitarium for wealthy people’s cats. There is oodles of fun and a hundred and
fifty crazy cats in this book, and a peculiar mystery of six vanished pink pearls.
</p>
<p>In the “Waltzing Hen” book you’ll meet old <span class="pageNum" id="pb.vii">[<a href="#pb.vii">vii</a>]</span>Cap’n Tinkertop and his hilarious dancing leg. A funny old coot! Why does the hen
waltz? What is the secret of the yellow man and the frisky white doorknob? Rip-roaring
reading here.
</p>
<p>In my “Talking Frog” book we help a boy pal save a peculiar invention of his father’s
from thieving hands. What is the shabby old soap peddler searching for, night after
night, in the vanished miser’s old mill? What does “ten and ten” mean? You’ll search
breathlessly for the answers to these and other riddles if you once get this gripping
fun-mystery-adventure book into your hands.

<h2 class="main">OUR CHATTER-BOX</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The earlier editions of this book did not contain a “Chatter-Box.” But so popular
has this department become (I started it with my sixteenth book) that my publisher
asked me to prepare a brief “Chatter-Box” for all of my early books.
</p>
<p>The boys and girls who read my books supply the material for this department. As the
author of the books, all I have to do is to assemble the material. If you are one
of the many hundreds of boys who have written to me, it may be that your letter was
incorporated in the “Chatter-Box” in one of my other books. Writers of accepted poems
receive, as a reward, a free autographed copy of the book in which their poem appears.
The fine poems (all written by boys and girls who call themselves Jerry Todd fans)
contained in the “Chatter-Boxes” in my recent books will interest you. But if you
can’t write poetry, built around the characters in my books, be sure and write me
a letter. If you make your letter interesting I’ll try hard to find a place for it
in a future “Chatter-Box.” I doubt if I could fully express the pleasure that I derive
from the many letters that I receive. My boy pals! That is the way I regard the writers
of these dandy letters. So the more letters I receive the more pals I’ll have. And
I sure like pals!
</p>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pageNum">[<a href="#toc">Contents</a>]</span><div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">LETTERS</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“One day,” writes Oswell Patout, Jr., of Jeanerette, La., “our gang (I’m enclosing
a picture showing the three of us reading Jerry Todd books) began receiving mysterious
maps and letters informing us about missing pearls. Here was a fine chance, we thought,
to solve a mystery like Jerry Todd and his gang. So we set to work in regular Juvenile
Jupiter Detective style. But, alas, the pearls were a fake. The letters and maps were
a trick of boy <span class="pageNum" id="pb.x">[<a href="#pb.x">x</a>]</span>friends of ours who know how ‘bugs’ we are about your peachy books.”
</p>
<p>“I’ve made up my mind that I’m going to be a book writer like you,” writes Charles
Jordan of Chicago, Ill., “or at least try to be. If all men were like you it sure
would be a swell world for us kids. I sure do appreciate your books. Yes, sir, I do.
My cousin and I have tried many times to do things like Jerry. But what can a fellow
do here in this big city! Boy, Jerry and his gang sure have peachy times, if you ask
me. Whenever I read a Jerry Todd book I have the feeling that I’m right there, going
through all the adventures the same as the other boys.”
</p>
<p>“I belong to a gang of Boy Scouts,” writes Billy Johnston of Little Rock, Ark. “We
have bully good times. One time we had a cave, to get into which we first had to raise
a trapdoor and then crawl through a dark tunnel.”
</p>
<p>Boy, that sounds hot! And I’m reminded, too, of the cave that Trigger Berg and his
pals built. Did you, Bill, like Trigger and his gang, catch a robber in your cave?
This episode of Trigger’s, I believe, took place in the <i>Treasure Tree</i> book.
</p>
<p>And as though in answer to Bill’s letter, Joe Griffith of Allegan, Mich., writes:
“Our cave, built back of our barn, didn’t last long. For a boy walked across the top
and two boards fell on the kid’s head who was inside. Ouch! I was glad it wasn’t me.”
</p>
<p>Also from Allegan comes this interesting letter from Jack (Yam) Hale: “As the leader
of our gang I am called Jerry Todd. Don Garlock is Peg. Zeb Jones is Scoop. And Si
Herrington is Red. Having a raft with a big slingshot on it we frequently dress up
like pirates, using wooden swords. Also we built a lean-to in the woods and made a
totem pole—not so good, though, as the one in Poppy’s book. Nor must I forget the
‘Stricker gang’ that we have battles with. That’s the name we have for a rival gang
near us. They’re hard, like Bid.”
</p>
<p>Here’s a joke (I think it’s good, too) sent in by Emanuel Bernstein of Newark, N.
J.:
</p>
<p>Jerry: “It’s only six o’clock. I told you to come over after supper.”
</p>
<p>Red: “That’s what I came after.”
</p>
<p>Another boy—George Browne of Rye, N. Y.—submits this one:
</p>
<p>Father, to little Tommie who had just started to school: “Well, son, what lesson do
you like best?”
</p>
<p>Tommie: “I like recess best.”
</p>
<p>And what do you think—Alfred Burke of Cranford, N. J., states that he has read the
<i>Whispering Cave</i> book twenty-four times!
<span class="pageNum" id="pb.xi">[<a href="#pb.xi">xi</a>]</span></p>
<p>Here’s another snappy one: “I tried to make a dinosaur egg,” writes Jack Hanson of
Rockford, Ill. Jack doesn’t say how the egg turned out. Yet how glad we are that he
didn’t try to lay it!
</p>
<p>“My chums and I recently organized a Juvenile Jupiter Detective Association,” writes
Wilfred Hinkel of Elmont, L. I., N. Y., “only we call ourselves the Jerry Todd Union
of Detectives. Boy! You should see our peachy badges.”

<h3 class="main">FRECKLED GOLDFISH</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Out of my book, <i>Poppy Ott and the Freckled Goldfish</i>, has grown our great Freckled Goldfish lodge, membership in which is open to all
boys and girls who are interested in my books. Thousands of readers have joined the
club. We have peachy membership cards (designed by Bert Salg, the popular illustrator
of my books) and fancy buttons. Also for members who want to organize branch clubs
(hundreds are in successful operation, providing boys and girls with added fun) we
have rituals.
</p>
<p>To join (and to be a loyal Jerry Todd fan I think you ought to join), please observe
these simple rules:
</p>
<p>(1) Write (or print) your name plainly.
</p>
<p>(2) Supply your complete printed address.
</p>
<p>(3) Give your age.
</p>
<p>(4) Enclose two two-cent postage stamps (for card and button).
</p>
<p>(5) Address your letter to

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">To help young organizers we have produced a printed ritual, which any member who wants
to start a Freckled Goldfish club in his own neighborhood can’t afford to be without.
This booklet tells how to organize the club, how to conduct meetings, how to transact
all club business, and, probably most important of all, how to initiate candidates.
</p>
<p>The complete initiation is given word for word. Naturally, these booklets are more
or less secret. So, if you send for one, please do not show it to anyone who isn’t
a Freckled Goldfish. Three chief officers will be required to put on the initiation,
which can be given in any member’s home, so, unless each officer is provided with
a booklet, much memorizing will have to be done. The best plan is to have three booklets
to a chapter. These may be secured (at cost) at six cents each (three two-cent stamps)
or three for sixteen cents (eight two-cent stamps). Address all orders to

<h3 class="main">CLUB NEWS</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“My chums and I,” writes Charles Lewis of Conneaut, Ohio, “are all Freckled Goldfish.
Calling our chapter the Freckled Fantails, we have secret rules, initiations and mysterious
departments, such as Juvenile Jupiter Detectives and Secret and Mysterious Order of
Humpty-Dumpty. Our password is ——”.
</p>
<p>You’ve heard about club members being in good standing. Well, Frank Boyd of Dunellen,
N. J., claims to be a member of our Freckled Goldfish lodge in good “sitting.”
</p>
<p>“I made some candy, like Andy Blake did in his book,” writes Frank, “but even our
dog Towser sniffed at it. Also, my chum and I made a kite ten feet high. It cost us
fifteen cents. A stick broke when the kite got as high as a telephone pole, and that
was the end of our fifteen cents.”
</p>
<p>Speaking of big kites, the new boys in <i>Andy Blake and the Pot of Gold</i> have a lot of fun with a huge kite. Andy himself is a young man; but the boys I refer
to are quite young. Hence this story will be interesting to very small boys.
</p>
<p>“Perhaps you’d be interested to know,” writes Freckled Goldfish George Lindsay, Jr.,
of Philadelphia, Pa., “that my father manufactures food for goldfish.”
</p>
<p>Well, well! We’re sure glad, George, to have such an authority in our ranks. If any
of our Goldfish get the “tummy-ache” we’ll turn them over to you for proper treatment.
</p>
<p>“All of the boys around here are Freckled Goldfish,” writes Thomas Keogh of Brooklyn,
N.&nbsp;Y. “So I want to join, too. And here’s a suggestion: You have Jerry Todd in the
Poppy Ott books, so why don’t you put Poppy in the Todd books? Also, tell me how many
members there are in the Freckled Goldfish lodge. The <i>Bob-Tailed Elephant</i> book is the funniest thing I ever read.”
</p>
<p>By the time this “Chatter-Box” appears in print we will have not less than 8,000 members
in our Goldfish lodge. As for your suggestion, both Scoop and Poppy are natural leaders.
We don’t need two leaders in a book. Nor would it be fair to push Poppy in front of
Scoop in the Todd books. A better plan is to let Scoop do the leading in one series
and Poppy in the other.
</p>
<p>“I would like to organize a local chapter,” writes Jim Gordon of Brooklyn, N. Y.,
“but there are not many boys around here. At the most I could get only five members.
Please tell me if that would be enough. Also I would like to know if my dog can join.
His name is Tramp.”
</p>
<p>If boys, conducting local chapters, want to include their pets in the chapter membership
<span class="pageNum" id="pb.xiii">[<a href="#pb.xiii">xiii</a>]</span>it certainly is all right with me. It takes three boys to organize a chapter. Many
of our chapters have only five members; some have less.
</p>
<p>“Ed Nilsson, a Freckled Goldfish, and I are going to organize a local chapter,” writes
James Elphinstone of Ludlow, Mass. “We have used Ed’s barn at other times for clubs.
But we feel sure our Freckled Goldfish club will be the best of all. The trapdoor
in the barn will come in handy during initiations! We have a pole in the old grain
chute, extending from the attic to the cellar. We go down it like real firemen. I
hope we don’t share Red’s grief and have a baby elephant cave in one side of our barn.”

<p class="first">And now, gang, I have some news for you. An autographed picture of Leo Edwards—in

OAK ISLAND TREASURE</h2>
<h2 class="label">CHAPTER I</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE “SALLY ANN”</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was summer vacation when this happened. We had been swimming in the fourth quarry
and had stopped at Dad’s brickyard canal dock on the way home.
</p>
<p>Scoop Ellery, our leader, reached for a rock the size of his fist and sent it crash-bang!
against the side of an old clay scow that was moored to the dock.
</p>
<p>“If I had money enough,” he grinned, “I’d buy that old tub and have some fun with
it.”
</p>
<p>Red Meyers scratched his freckled nose.
</p>
<p>“What kind of fun?” he wanted to know, wondering, I guess, what use one could make
of the weather-beaten old scow.
</p>
<p>“Well,” considered Scoop, cocking his eyes at <span class="pageNum" id="pb2">[<a href="#pb2">2</a>]</span>the scow, “it would make a swell houseboat, for one thing.”
</p>
<p>“Let’s do it,” I promptly encouraged, picturing to myself the dandy fun that we could
have in the Tutter canal with a houseboat. Hot dog! “Dad won’t care,” I hurried on.
“Honest. For he told me that he was going to drag the scow out of the water and knock
it to pieces.”
</p>
<p>Here Peg Shaw, our big chum, came into the conversation.
</p>
<p>“If your pa’ll let us use it,” he said to me, with an ear-to-ear grin, “I know how
we can earn some money with it.”
</p>
<p>Well, that sounded darby. For boys like to earn money. And if we could have fun doing
it, as seemed very probable, so much the better.
</p>
<p>Then Peg told us that it was his scheme to get up a boat show, patterned after the
boat shows that used to travel on the Mississippi River years ago, only, of course,
our show was to be a small one as compared to the early river shows. We could easily
make the audience seats, our chum explained in reciting his scheme, and build a stage
at one end of the boat.
</p>
<p>Red wanted to give a picture show.
</p>
<p>“I’ve got a peachy moving picture machine,” he told us.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb3">[<a href="#pb3">3</a>]</span></p>
<p>“What’s the matter with our black art show?” Scoop suggested.
</p>
<p>“The black art show,” Peg said, waggling, “is what I had in mind.”
</p>
<p>“Oh, baby!” I cried. “Won’t we have fun?”
</p>
<p>Scoop had been studying sleight of hand tricks and his book of instructions told how
to stage an amateur black art show. Black art is a good magic trick. Anybody can do
it, as I will explain later on in my story. In June we put on the show in Red’s barn.
It was fun. We took in ninety-five cents, which was pretty good for the first time.
If Peg, the big cow, hadn’t stumbled over a lantern, thereby setting fire to one of
Mrs. Meyers’ sheets that we were using on the stage, we probably would have made a
lot of money giving black art shows. But we had to go out of the show business when
Mr. Meyers put a padlock on the barn door.
</p>
<p>Now we were going to be showmen again! We were glad. The more we talked about the
boat show scheme the better we liked it. In the first place it was <i>different</i>. People who had laughed at our barn show, calling it a kid affair, would be interested
in our boat show. And we wouldn’t have any competition, because we would be the owners
of the only flat-bottomed boat in town. <span class="pageNum" id="pb4">[<a href="#pb4">4</a>]</span>Other boys might envy us, but they wouldn’t be able to take any of our business away
from us by starting a rival boat show. Certain of success, we were eager to begin.
But first I had to gain Dad’s consent.
</p>
<p>The old clay scow is a part of his brickyard outfit. I guess it was built years and
years before I was born. Anyway, I remember it as one of the first things in the brickyard
that drew my attention. I was sorry when they quit using it. For it was fun to ride
up the shady canal to the clay pit and back again to the factory where the clay was
made into bricks. It took two men to manage the scow when it was in use. One man drove
the team of mules that did the towing and the other man handled the big rudder, thereby
keeping the loaded scow in the canal’s channel. As you can imagine it was rather slow
traveling, for the mules never moved faster than a walk; but, as I say, it was fun
nevertheless.
</p>
<p>Nowadays all of Dad’s clay comes into the brickyard on big motor trucks. And it was
because he had no use for the scow that he had told me that he was going to knock
it to pieces.
</p>
<p>That evening at the supper table I told my folks about our swell show scheme. They
laughed.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb5">[<a href="#pb5">5</a>]</span></p>
<p>“What won’t you and that Ellery boy think up next!” Mother said.
</p>
<p>“It’s a dandy scheme,” I told her. “We’ll make a lot of money. It’ll be fun, too.”
</p>
<p>“I only hope,” she said, when I had gotten permission to use the old scow, “that the
boat won’t spring a leak and sink in the middle of the canal during one of your shows.”
</p>
<p>“No danger of that,” laughed Dad, who knew how well built the scow was. He caught
my eyes. “Did I understand you to say,” he quizzed across the table, “that it’s going
to be a magic show?”
</p>
<p>“The same as we put on in Red’s barn,” I nodded.
</p>
<p>“Who’s the magician?—Scoop?”
</p>
<p>I gave another nod.
</p>
<p>“He’s also the general manager of our show company,” I informed.
</p>
<p>Mother smiled.
</p>
<p>“What are you,” she inquired in fun, “the traffic manager?”
</p>
<p>I told her, with dignity, that I was the treasurer, which was a very important and
trustworthy position, and handled the money.
</p>
<p>“Peg’s the secretary,” I further informed, “and Red’s the ticket agent.”
</p>
<p>Dad considered.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb6">[<a href="#pb6">6</a>]</span></p>
<p>“How would it be,” he suggested, starting his nonsense, “if you put on a trapeze act?
Mother and I are crazy to get our names on the program; and trapeze stuff is our specialty.”
</p>
<p>“The very idea!” sputtered Mother, who knew, of course, that Dad was trying to bother
her. He likes to tease people. I’ll tell the world that I get my share of it!
</p>
<p>After supper I picked up Red and the two of us went in search of Peg and Scoop to
tell them the good news that the scow was ours. They were at Peg’s house, where Scoop
was importantly lettering a fancy cloth sign. Here it is:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first center"><i>THE “SALLY ANN” SHOW COMPANY
<br>Mystery and Magic
<br>To-night at 8:30
<br>Admission, Including War Tax, 15c.
<br>Children 10c.</i></p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>Red hates girls.
</p>
<p>“Who’s ‘Sally Ann’?” he scowled, letting out his freckled neck at the sign.
</p>
<p>Scoop quickly read the other’s thoughts.
</p>
<p>“You’ll like Sal,” he grinned.
</p>
<p>“If you’re going to have a gurl in it,” Red balked, “you can count me out,” and he
hitched up his pants and started off.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb7">[<a href="#pb7">7</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Hey; come here!”
</p>
<p>“Nothin’ doin’.”
</p>
<p>“ ‘Sally Ann,’ ” laughed Scoop, “is the name of our show boat.”
</p>
<p>Red gave a disgusted snort.
</p>
<p>“Named after a gurl! Huh! Why don’t you name it after a boy?”
</p>
<p>“A boat,” explained Scoop, “is usually a ‘she.’ Anyway,” he defended, “ ‘Sally Ann’
is a good name. I’ve got it printed that way and I’m not going to change it.”
</p>
<p>Like Red, I didn’t think very much of our leader’s choice of a name for our show boat.
But I kept shut. For you can’t argue Scoop down.
</p>
<p>“I’m going to make two of these signs,” he explained to us. “One for each side of
the boat. I can finish the job to-night. And to-morrow we’ll put up the stage and
build the seats.”
</p>
<p>“Hot dog!” I cried, thinking of the fun we were going to have.
</p>
<p>“It will take a lot of coin to get started,” he went on, “so we better check up and
find out how we stand on the money question. I can put in seven dollars.” He looked
at me. “How much are you good for, Jerry?”
</p>
<p>I knew that I could depend on Dad and Mother to help me out. It would be a loan, sort
of. <span class="pageNum" id="pb8">[<a href="#pb8">8</a>]</span>Later on, when the show was earning money, I could pay them back out of my share of
the profits.
</p>
<p>“I’ll bring ten dollars to-morrow morning,” I told our leader.
</p>
<p>“So will I,” promised Red, who has more truck than any other kid in Tutter. If he
took a sudden notion to start a circus all he would have to do would be to whistle
and his folks would stock him up with a baby elephant and a flock of camels.
</p>
<p>Peg was silent.
</p>
<p>“I don’t like to ask Pa for money,” he finally spoke up. “For he has to work hard
for what he gets. If I could sell some of my rabbits.…”
</p>
<p>“Don’t sell the white one,” grinned Scoop, “for we need it in our act. Remember?—I
wave the magic wand over the empty teacup and out jumps a white rabbit.”
</p>
<p>“Tommy Hegan wants to buy a pair of rabbits,” I told Peg, who promised to call on
the Grove Street kid the first thing in the morning.
</p>
<p>Scoop was adding in his mind.
</p>
<p>“If you can get three dollars,” he told Peg, “we’ll have an even thirty. That ought
to be enough to start with.”
</p>
<p>“Thirty dollars,” repeated Red, thinking of his stomach. “That will buy—um—three hundred
<span class="pageNum" id="pb9">[<a href="#pb9">9</a>]</span>ten-cent dishes of <span class="corr" id="xd31e726" title="Source: ice ceam">ice-cream</span>; or six hundred ice-cream cones; or three thousand penny sticks of licorice; or——”
</p>
<p>Scoop gave the hungry one a contemptuous up-and-down look.
</p>
<p>“Good-night!” he groaned, throwing up his hands. “It’s a hopeless case.”
</p>
<p>Red grinned. For he likes to get Scoop’s goat.
</p>
<p>“I can’t work,” he strutted around, holding his freckled nose in the air, “if I can’t
eat. And if you expect me to put in ten dollars——”
</p>
<p>“Your ten dollars is an <i>investment</i>,” explained Scoop, who has learned a lot about business from his father. “It gives
you a quarter interest in the company.” He paused, then added with a grin: “If we
take in a million dollars, you get a quarter of it.”
</p>
<p>“I’ll be satisfied,” Peg spoke up in his sensible way, “if we make a hundred dollars
… twenty-five dollars apiece. I’ve been wanting a bicycle.”
</p>
<p>“You and me both,” I put in.
</p>
<p>“Well,” grinned Scoop, “it’s a bit unlikely that we’ll get to be millionaires. Still,
you never can tell.”

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER II</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE ENEMY</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Before I go any deeper into my story I will tell you about our canal, for you will
need this information to thoroughly understand what follows.
</p>
<p>We call it the Tutter canal, for the reason that it runs through our small town. Over
in Ashton, a neighboring small town, the kids call it the Ashton canal. It is a hundred
miles long, I guess. Maybe longer. It was built by the state to connect the great
lakes with the Gulf of Mexico through the Illinois River and the Mississippi River.
</p>
<p>It isn’t more than forty feet wide where it passes through Tutter. One bank forms
a tow path, which was necessary when the canal was new because in those olden days
all of the grain boats were drawn by horses and mules. To-day the few boats that come
through Tutter are drawn by smoky tugs.
</p>
<p>In the same way that a single-track railroad has <span class="pageNum" id="pb11">[<a href="#pb11">11</a>]</span>sidings that permit trains traveling in opposite directions to pass each other, our
canal has “wide waters,” where the canal boats meet and pass. There is a wide waters
below Tutter and another one between our town and Ashton. The biggest wide waters
that I have seen is the one between Ashton and Steam Corners. Here the canal is more
than a mile wide, a sort of lake, though the water for the most part is shallow, with
a mud bottom. The channel is marked with parallel rows of piles painted white.
</p>
<p>Dad says that before the canal was built the Oak Island wide waters was a swamp and
the island that I am going to tell you about in my story was a rocky knoll. Of its
many trees the largest one is an oak, which grows on the island’s highest point, and
it is this noticeable oak that gained for the island its name.
</p>
<p>Well, to get back to my story, we met at Scoop’s father’s grocery store the following
morning, no less enthused over our scheme than we had been the preceding evening,
each one supplied with his promised share of the new company’s working capital. As
treasurer the money was turned over to me. I felt pretty big to have so much money
in my pocket. And I sort of held my chest out as I hurried with the others to the
<span class="pageNum" id="pb12">[<a href="#pb12">12</a>]</span>brickyard dock to begin work on our show boat.
</p>
<p>Having been built purposely for clay hauling, the flat-bottomed scow was mostly pit,
with a deck at each square end. These decks were small, not more than fourteen feet
wide (the width of the scow) by four feet deep, but we figured that we could build
our stage on the front deck and have plenty of room. The audience seats were to be
built in the pit. Such were our plans. And anxious to get everything in readiness,
so that we could give our first show and begin earning money, we set to work.
</p>
<p>There was a lot of old lumber in the brickyard. Dad said we could sort it over and
use what pieces we needed if we would promise to bring the lumber back when we retired,
wealthy, from the show business. We promised. And lugging the necessary material to
the dock we sawed and nailed until we had the pit filled with benches. It was tiresome
work, but we didn’t mind that. For a boy doesn’t mind working hard and getting slivers
in his fingers when he is working for himself.
</p>
<p>It took us all of the morning to make the seats. Before we could build the stage,
the next important job, we had to get our painted canvas, which was stored in Red’s
barn. We had other <span class="pageNum" id="pb13">[<a href="#pb13">13</a>]</span>stuff, too, that we had used in our barn show; and, as it was too heavy to lug, Scoop
borrowed one of his father’s delivery wagons.
</p>
<p>We put in the best part of the afternoon working on the stage. It was a big job. First
we built a framework for the lights, and back of that we fixed canvas wings, painted
black, with a black canvas at the back and a black floor piece. Lacking the necessary
material, we were unable to cover the stage and the seats. If it rained everything
would get soaked. But we couldn’t help that.
</p>
<p>“Now,” said Scoop, directing the work, “we’ll build a ticket stand, and when that
job is done we’ll call it a day and quit.”
</p>
<p>Peg straightened and looked around, sort of checking up on our work.
</p>
<p>“Seats made—stage built—ticket stand won’t take more than an hour.” He looked at us
in turn. “Fellows, we ought to be able to open up for business to-morrow night. What
do you think?”
</p>
<p>“Easy,” I said.
</p>
<p>While we were working on the ticket stand a gang of five boys our age came into sight.
</p>
<p>“What yo’ doin’?” Bid Stricker wanted to know from the dock.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb14">[<a href="#pb14">14</a>]</span></p>
<p>We don’t like the Strickers for two cents. They’re a bunch of roughnecks. All they
ever want to do is to fight and play mean tricks on people. We don’t believe in that.
And because we won’t gang with them, and do the mean things they do, they have it
in for us.
</p>
<p>“Beat it,” growled Scoop, motioning the unwelcome newcomers away.
</p>
<p>But they didn’t budge.
</p>
<p>“Must be some kind of a show,” Bid hung on, letting out his neck at the stage and
seats.
</p>
<p>“Tell them,” I nudged our leader. “Maybe we can get some money out of them.”
</p>
<p>“Yes,” Scoop told the inquisitive ones, following my advice, “we’re going to give
a show. Ten cents for kids. And it’s a peachy show, too. You fellows want to come
and see it. You’ll be sorry if you miss it.”
</p>
<p>“What kind of a show?” Bid inquired.
</p>
<p>“Magic.”
</p>
<p>“Who’s the magician?”
</p>
<p>“Me,” Scoop informed modestly, putting out his chest.
</p>
<p>Bid’s cousin gave a scornful laugh.
</p>
<p>“A punk show, I bet.”
</p>
<p>“Punk is right,” another member of the gang <span class="pageNum" id="pb15">[<a href="#pb15">15</a>]</span>chimed in. “Look at the punk seats,” the jealous one pointed. “<i>Some</i> carpenters!”
</p>
<p>“Wood butchers,” jeered Jimmy Stricker.
</p>
<p>“And look at the punk stage.”
</p>
<p>That made us hot. For we were proud of our work, as we had a right to be. And, with
Peg in the lead, we took after the smart alecks and chased them away.
</p>
<p>“We’ll fix your old show,” Bid yelled back.
</p>
<p>“Try it,” dared Peg, “and see what happens to you.”
</p>
<p>We went back to the show boat.
</p>
<p>“Now that they know what we’re doing,” Peg said, wiping his sweaty face on his shirt
sleeve, “they won’t rest easy until they’ve smashed up something. For you know Bid
Stricker! And you heard what he said. If he gets half a chance he’ll put us out of
business, just as sure as shootin’. We’ve got to be prepared, fellows.”
</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t put it past him,” growled Scoop, “to bore a hole in the bottom of our
boat and sink it. He’d think it was smart to do a stunt like that.”
</p>
<p>“It’ll pay us,” waggled Peg, “to keep a close eye on our truck after this.”
</p>
<p>“Aw!…” rebelled Red, scowling, when it <span class="pageNum" id="pb16">[<a href="#pb16">16</a>]</span>was suggested that we guard the show boat day and night. “I don’t want to stay here
all the time. I’ve got to eat.”
</p>
<p>“We’ll work in pairs,” planned Peg, disregarding the smaller one’s objection. “Jerry
and I will stand guard to-night and you two fellows can stand guard to-morrow night.”
</p>
<p>Scoop laughed.
</p>
<p>“What’s the matter, Red? You look sort of white under your freckles. Are you scared?”
</p>
<p>“I have a hunch,” worried Red, looking ahead, “that I’m going to end up with a black
eye or a punch in the jaw. For what chance has two fellows got against five?”
</p>
<p>I had thought of that.
</p>
<p>“Maybe we better stick together,” I suggested, getting Peg’s eyes.
</p>
<p>But he wasn’t worried like me.
</p>
<p>“Five o’clock,” he told us, looking at his watch.
</p>
<p>“We’ll have to snap into it,” Scoop said, “if we expect to finish the ticket stand
to-day.”
</p>
<p>“You fellows can work on it,” Peg directed, “while Jerry and I go home for our bedding.
For, if we’re going to stay here to-night, we’ve got to have something to sleep on.
Come on, Jerry.”
</p>
<p>Peg is big and strong and awfully gritty. He <span class="pageNum" id="pb17">[<a href="#pb17">17</a>]</span>isn’t afraid of anybody or anything. I’m pretty gritty myself. I don’t run when a
bigger fellow starts picking on me.
</p>
<p>But, truthfully, I didn’t like this “two-against-five” business. It was risky. And
I told Peg so on the way home.
</p>
<p>He patted me on the back, grinning.
</p>
<p>“Cheer up, Jerry. I’ve got a scheme.”

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was dark as pitch. The moon and stars were hidden behind a black wall. I couldn’t
see a thing—not even my hand when I held it within an inch of my nose.
</p>
<p>A breeze had sprung up as the day had died and the darkness had crept in. From where
I lay on the stage of our show boat, wrapped in my blanket, the breeze fanning my
face, I could hear the steady lap! lap! lap! of the canal’s waves as they hungrily
licked the boat’s flat nose.
</p>
<p>In preparing for a possible night attack, Peg and I had anchored the scow in the middle
of the canal. This gave us an advantage over the enemy, even though we were fewer
in numbers. If they tried to run a plank from the dock to the scow, we could easily
knock the plank into the canal before they could make use of it. Or, if they came
in a rowboat, we could force them back, using our clubs, if necessary.
</p>
<p>It was pretty smart of Peg to think up this scheme, I thought.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb19">[<a href="#pb19">19</a>]</span></p>
<p>The agreement had been made between us that we were to watch in turns. This would
enable each of us to get some needed sleep. I was to rest an hour while my companion
watched, then he was to sleep while I watched. The trouble was that I couldn’t get
to sleep when it was my turn to rest. The thought of our coming success as showman,
the thought of a possible night attack by the enemy, kept me awake.
</p>
<p>There was a sudden rumbling crash on the roof of the sky.
</p>
<p>“Jerry,” Peg whispered out of the darkness, and I heard his quick, guarded footsteps.
</p>
<p>“Yes?” I breathed, getting to my feet in the sudden tense thought that the Strickers
had come.
</p>
<p>“It’s going to rain.”
</p>
<p>“Oh!…” I lost my sudden tenseness and started breathing again. “Put up your umbrella,”
I joked.
</p>
<p>“I wish I had one. Our bedding will get soaked.”
</p>
<p>“You seem to overlook the fact,” I laughed, “that this is a regular boat.”
</p>
<p>“Huh!”
</p>
<p>“And every regular boat,” I went on, “has a cabin.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb20">[<a href="#pb20">20</a>]</span></p>
<p>“What do you mean?”
</p>
<p>“There’s a hatchway in the other deck.”
</p>
<p>“Crickets! I never thought of that.”
</p>
<p>Using a flashlight to light our way, we went quickly to the rear deck and raised the
hinged hatch, which was fitted with a hasp and pin.
</p>
<p>There wasn’t much space under the deck. But it was better to squeeze, I told Peg,
than to get soaked. So we shoved our bedding into the hole, where tools such as shovels
and picks had been kept under padlock when the scow had been used for clay hauling.
</p>
<p>Peg crept into the hole, flashing the light ahead of him.
</p>
<p>“What if the Strickers come?”
</p>
<p>“They won’t come in the rain,” I predicted.
</p>
<p>“I saw them just before dark.”
</p>
<p>“In the brickyard?”
</p>
<p>“Sure thing. They were watching us.”
</p>
<p>“We’re safe from them now.”
</p>
<p>“I hope so.” He laughed. “Well, here’s hoping that our cabin roof doesn’t leak.”
</p>
<p>“If it does,” I joked, following him into the hole, “we’ll have it shingled to-morrow.”
</p>
<p>“Ouch!” cried my big chum, bumping his head against a deck beam. “Bend your back,
Jerry. This is worse than crawling under a barn.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb21">[<a href="#pb21">21</a>]</span></p>
<p>Pretty soon we were settled in our blankets. It was pouring now. The wind was blowing
a gale. I could feel the <i>Sally Ann</i> tugging at the anchor ropes.
</p>
<p>Would our stage be blown down? I sort of counted the seconds, worried-like, expecting
any moment to hear a crash. But none came. And after a bit the wind died down.
</p>
<p>“Hum-m-m-m!” yawned Peg, stretching in the dark and swatting me on the nose. I told
him to cut it out.
</p>
<p>Patter! patter! patter! There was lulling music in the dancing raindrops. A sleepy
feeling crept over me. I was glad in the moment that it was Peg’s turn to watch. I
closed my eyes. And then.…
</p>
<p>I must have slept for more than an hour. Anyway, when I awoke there was no sound of
raindrops on the deck above my face. The storm had passed over. Through a crack I
could see a shimmering star.
</p>
<p>Something had awakened me. Suddenly. I had a frightened, jumpy feeling. I rubbed my
eyes, trying to remember what I had dreamt. <i>A ghost!</i> That was it. I had dreamt of a whispering ghost.
</p>
<p>What was that? I listened, breathless, raising <span class="pageNum" id="pb22">[<a href="#pb22">22</a>]</span>myself on my hands. My heart was thumping. Footsteps. Near by. Guarded and stealthy.
</p>
<p>“Nobody here,” a low voice spoke up. “They must have gone home.”
</p>
<p>It was the Strickers! The enemy had out-tricked us—had caught us napping and now were
in possession of our boat. I went cold, sort of, in the knowledge of our humiliating
predicament.
</p>
<p>Peg was still asleep. I could hear him snoring. I shook him, telling him to wake up.
In my sudden crazy excitement I completely forgot about the beams over my head. Raising
quickly, I got an awful bump on the forehead. It sort of knocked me silly.
</p>
<p>“Oh-h-h-h!” I groaned, falling back.
</p>
<p>There was a sudden silence.
</p>
<p>“I heard a voice,” breathed Jimmy Stricker.
</p>
<p>“Me, too,” another boy spoke up.
</p>
<p>“Under the stage.”
</p>
<p>A slit of light, from a flashlight, appeared in the crack through which the star had
been visible to me in the moment of my awakening.
</p>
<p>“Look! Here’s a hatch.”
</p>
<p>“Raise it,” commanded Bid. “I’ve got a club. And if a head comes up I’ll whack it.”
</p>
<p>The hatch was raised cautiously … a light flashed into my blinking eyes.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb23">[<a href="#pb23">23</a>]</span></p>
<p>“It’s them!” cried Bid. “Close it—<i>quick</i>!”
</p>
<p>Bang! went the hatch.
</p>
<p>“Lock it!” cried Bid.
</p>
<p>Peg stirred at the slamming of the hatch.
</p>
<p>“What the dickens?…” he mumbled, awakening. “I must have been asleep.” He shook me.
“Did you hear that loud thunder clap, Jerry? It woke me up.”
</p>
<p>I was dizzy. My head ached. But I was able to think and to talk.
</p>
<p>“It wasn’t thunder,” I told him. “It was the Strickers. They’ve captured our boat.
We’re locked in.”
</p>
<p>He gave a queer choking throat sound and started to get up.
</p>
<p>“Ouch!” he cried, bumping his head.
</p>
<p>“Two monkeys in a cage,” yipped Bid Stricker.
</p>
<p>“Open that hatch,” roared Peg, furious.
</p>
<p>“Listen!” screeched Bid. “One of the monkeys can talk. Just like a human bein’.”
</p>
<p>“I’ll ‘human bein’’ you,” threatened Peg, “if you don’t let us out of here. You know
me, Bid!”
</p>
<p>“Beg some more,” jeered Bid. “We like it.”
</p>
<p>Well, I can’t begin to tell you how awful we felt. We are pretty smart. We think that
we are a lot smarter than the Strickers. It was galling <span class="pageNum" id="pb24">[<a href="#pb24">24</a>]</span>to us therefore to have them get the upper hand of us. And we were further sickened
in the thought that they would throw our stage and seats into the canal. Our day’s
work would be for nothing. But what could we do to defend our property? Not a thing.
We were helpless—trapped like rats in a wire cage.
</p>
<p>Suddenly a shrill scream pierced our ears.
</p>
<p>“<i>Oh!</i>…” cried Bid, and there was unmistakable fear in his voice. “<i>Oh!</i>…”
</p>
<p>There was a scurry of feet … the sound of diminishing gasping voices … silence.
</p>
<p>And all this, mind you, when we had expected to hear the sound of ripping stage boards!
</p>
<p>“They’re running away,” cried Peg, bewildered in the unexpected turn of affairs.
</p>
<p>“Let us out,” I screeched, pounding on the hatch in the hope that the enemy would
return and release us.
</p>
<p>And now comes the weird part of my story—the beginning of the mystery.
</p>
<p>“<i>Where … are … you?</i>”
</p>
<p>The voice came from the other side of the hatch, a peculiar whispering voice.
</p>
<p>“We’re under the deck,” cried Peg. “We’re locked in. Let us out. Please.”
</p>
<p>I suddenly clutched my chum’s arm.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb25">[<a href="#pb25">25</a>]</span></p>
<p>“No!” I cried, in a panic of fear, “No!”
</p>
<p>“What’s the matter, Jerry?”
</p>
<p>“It’s a ghost,” I cried, crazy. “I saw it in my dream. I heard it. It’s a whispering
ghost. Don’t let it in.”
</p>
<p>“Ghost? You’re batty.”
</p>
<p>With these grunted words my companion lifted the hatch, which had been unlatched by
the unseen whisperer. And unwilling to be left alone, I followed him through the hole.
</p>
<p>The moon was shining. We could see every part of the boat. A plank was laid from the
dock to the scow. Here was the course that the invaders had taken in their tumbling,
panicky flight.
</p>
<p>But the Strickers were nowhere in sight. No one was in sight.
</p>
<p>“Well, I’ll be jiggered!” gasped Peg, dumfounded.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE MERRY-GO-ROUND ORGAN</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Scoop was on hand the following morning at five o’clock. Peg and I were glad to see
him. For our stomachs were empty and we wanted to go home to breakfast.
</p>
<p>But before we left for home we told the industrious early-riser about our weird experience.
At first he refused to take our story seriously. It was a crazy dream, he ridiculed.
</p>
<p>Peg soberly shook his head.
</p>
<p>“No, it wasn’t a dream. For we both were wide awake. Jerry declares it was a whispering
ghost that visited us. And maybe he’s right. I can’t say that it wasn’t a ghost. Certainly
it acted queer enough to be one.”
</p>
<p>“I don’t believe in ghosts,” boasted Scoop.
</p>
<p>“Neither did I,” I shot back at him, looking him straight in the eye, “until last
night.”
</p>
<p>“A ghost! You’re funny, Jerry.”
</p>
<p>“All my life,” I followed up, waggling, “I’ve carried in my mind a sort of idea of
what a ghost’s voice would be like, <i>if</i> there was such a <span class="pageNum" id="pb27">[<a href="#pb27">27</a>]</span>thing as a ghost. And twice last night I heard exactly that kind of a voice.”
</p>
<p>“It <i>was</i> a queer voice,” Peg told Scoop, serious. “Sort of hollow, like a whisper in a dark
tomb.”
</p>
<p>“Jinks! If you fellows keep on talking about tombs, backing each other up in your
crazy story, you’ll have me actually believing that your visitor <i>was</i> a ghost.”
</p>
<p>“If it wasn’t a ghost,” I said, to a good point, “why did the Strickers scream and
run away?”
</p>
<p>“The Strickers are likely to do anything.”
</p>
<p>“They wouldn’t have been afraid of a man.”
</p>
<p>“Maybe,” Scoop grinned, keeping up the argument, “the man had a gun or a sword.”
</p>
<p>“Bunk!” I grunted, disgusted with the arguer, who is never so happy as when he is
trying, superior-like, to talk some one else down. “They saw a ghost,” I waggled,
“and nothing else but.”
</p>
<p>My stiff attitude seemed to amuse the other.
</p>
<p>“All right,” he nodded. “Have it your own way. It was a ghost, as you say. And what
<i>is</i> a ghost? A supernatural thing, if we are to believe the crazy stories that we have
heard. And, being supernatural, a ghost, of course, knows everything. It doesn’t have
to ask questions. It <i>knows</i> what it wants to know without asking. Isn’t that right?”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb28">[<a href="#pb28">28</a>]</span></p>
<p>I nodded.
</p>
<p>“All right!” he came back quickly, a snappier sparkle in his eyes. “If this visitor
of yours was a ghost, as you declare, why did it <i>ask</i> you where you were? Explain that, if you can.”
</p>
<p>Peg scratched his head and squinted at me.
</p>
<p>“That’s a good argument, Jerry.”
</p>
<p>But I wasn’t going to back down and let the smart one have everything his own way.
</p>
<p>“Huh!” I said, standing by my belief.
</p>
<p>Scoop was still grinning, contented, I imagine, in the thought of how very smart he
was!
</p>
<p>“As I say,” he went on, “I don’t believe in ghosts, and consequently I don’t know
very much about them. But from what I’ve heard, I have the impression that a ghost
is sort of unfriendly. Of a mean disposition, it delights to sneak up on people. And
the more people it scares into fits, the merrier for it. That is <i>my</i> idea of a ghost, Yet, if I am to believe your story, <i>this</i> ghost did you a good turn.”
</p>
<p>“A friendly ghost,” grinned Peg, amused in the thought. “Haw! haw! haw!” he burst
out, in his rough way. “It isn’t every company of showmen with a friendly ghost on
their side. We’re lucky.”
</p>
<p>At Scoop’s request I repeated my dream.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb29">[<a href="#pb29">29</a>]</span></p>
<p>“I was in a cave,” I told him. “It was dark. Like the inside of a cistern at midnight.
I could feel something near me. A sort of invisible thing. Then I heard a low, whispering
voice. ‘Where … are … you?’ I couldn’t see a thing, as I say. But somehow I knew that
it was a ghost that was whispering to me. ‘Where … are … you?’ it breathed again.
I wanted to run away. But I couldn’t move. I was scared stiff. A sort of paralysis.
Every second I expected to feel the pressure of its cold hand on mine. Ough! I was
full of shivers. Then, sudden-like, I was wide awake.”
</p>
<p>“And the voice that you heard after the Strickers had gone was the same voice that
you heard in your dream?”
</p>
<p>I nodded.
</p>
<p>“Not only the same voice,” I told him, “but the same words.”
</p>
<p>He was puzzled.
</p>
<p>“I’ve been told,” he said, thinking, “that dreams happen in a flash. And I guess it’s
so. For one night when it was storming Mother came into my bedroom to close my window.
The creaking of the window pulleys sort of registered in my sleeping mind. And I had
a long, crazy dream about burglars. To have done what I did in the <span class="pageNum" id="pb30">[<a href="#pb30">30</a>]</span>dream would have taken an hour or more. Yet it all happened in an instant.”
</p>
<p>“If that is the case,” I reasoned out, “I must have heard the whispering voice in
my sleep.”
</p>
<p>“It was the whispering voice,” the leader declared, coming to a quick conclusion,
“that caused you to dream of the ghost.”
</p>
<p>“What?” cried Peg, surprised. “Do you mean to say that Jerry heard the whispering
voice <i>before</i> the Strickers came?”
</p>
<p>Scoop nodded, sure of himself.
</p>
<p>“I can’t understand it,” cried Peg, looking dizzy. “Why should a man mysteriously
board our boat in the middle of the night? What object could he have had? Who was
he? Why did he whisper to us, asking where we were? And where did he vanish to?”
</p>
<p>“It was a ghost,” I hung on.
</p>
<p>Scoop laughed.
</p>
<p>“Let it be a ghost, if you insist. We should worry, as long as it’s a friendly ghost.”
</p>
<p>Peg was struggling, in his slow, steady way, to get his thoughts straightened out.
</p>
<p>“But if the man was here in advance of the Strickers, as you say, how did he get on
the boat? There was no plank then.”
</p>
<p>“You and Jerry ought to know more about that <span class="pageNum" id="pb31">[<a href="#pb31">31</a>]</span>than any one else,” shrugged Scoop, “for you were here when it happened.” Then he
added, in a lighter voice: “But let’s forget about your mysterious whisperer for the
present. If there’s a mystery here, we probably can solve it to-night.”
</p>
<p>“You think the man will come back?”
</p>
<p>“It isn’t unlikely.”
</p>
<p>Peg’s black eyes snapped.
</p>
<p>“Gosh! I wish it was my turn to watch.”
</p>
<p>“I imagine,” laughed Scoop, “that Red will be tickled pink to let you have his place.”
</p>
<p>“Where is Red?” I spoke up, thus reminded of our absent chum. “Why didn’t you bring
him with you?”
</p>
<p>“What? Get that sleepy-head out of bed before eight o’clock? You must think I know
how to work miracles, Jerry.”
</p>
<p>“I’ll stop for him on my way back,” I said, starting off abreast of Peg.
</p>
<p>“Make it snappy,” Scoop told us. “For there’s a million things to do before we can
open up our show.” Then he called after us, laughing: “Don’t forget to look on the
front page of last night’s <i>Daily Globe</i> when you get home.”
</p>
<p>Peg and I wondered at this remark. And to find out what the leader meant, we quickened
our steps toward home. I grabbed the newspaper <span class="pageNum" id="pb32">[<a href="#pb32">32</a>]</span>as soon as I was in the house. And here is the heading that met my eager eyes on the
front page:
</p>
<p class="xd31e1061"><i>CLAY SCOW TRANSFORMED BY LOCAL BOYS INTO FLOATING THEATER</i>
</p>
<p>Giving our names, the newspaper article stated that we had transformed the old brickyard
clay scow into a fine floating theater, with a stage and seats, and were planning
to give black art shows, an attraction that undoubtedly would prove popular with both
old and young.
</p>
<p>“So, why should we care,” the article concluded, in nonsense, “if Ashton has the new
county jail? For <i>we</i> have the <i>Sally Ann</i>! And our only editorial regret is that our enterprising young showmen haven’t a motor
on their unique craft, for we would delight to have them toot their show horn at Ashton’s
canal door, to thus awaken that somnolent community to Tutter’s exceptional enterprise.
In Tutter, the town that does things, we start young!”
</p>
<p>Well, I stared at the concluding paragraph, reading it a second time. “And our only
editorial regret is that our enterprising young showmen haven’t a motor.…”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb33">[<a href="#pb33">33</a>]</span></p>
<p>Jinks! Smart as we were, we hadn’t thought of that. But wouldn’t it be peachy, though?
And think of the money we could make! For if we got as far as Ashton with our show,
what was there to hinder us from going farther?
</p>
<p>Gobbling down my breakfast, with Mother scolding me for eating so fast, I hoofed it
to the brickyard dock, forgetting all about my promise to stop for Red.
</p>
<p>“Did you put the article in the newspaper?” I asked Scoop.
</p>
<p>He nodded.
</p>
<p>“Pa suggested it. ‘Go over and tell Editor Stair about your new boat show,’ he told
me yesterday noon. ‘Make him publish the story in his newspaper. He gets a lot of
money out of me for store advertising. So, as a member of the family, you’re entitled
to all the publicity that you can get.’ ”
</p>
<p>“ ‘Publicity,’ ” I repeated. “What’s that?”
</p>
<p>“The article that you just read in the newspaper is publicity. It tells the Tutter
people about our show in a news way. That’s publicity, Pa says.”
</p>
<p>“It’s advertising,” I said.
</p>
<p>“Publicity and advertising are much the same thing. Only, as I understand it, you
get publicity <span class="pageNum" id="pb34">[<a href="#pb34">34</a>]</span>for nothing and you pay for advertising. By the way, Jerry, I told Mr. Stair that
we would put an advertisement in his newspaper when we got ready to open up our show.
Don’t let me forget about it. We’ve got to order tickets, too.”
</p>
<p>“Why not get some more publicity,” I suggested, eager to hang on to our thirty dollars,
“and let the advertising go. It’ll be cheaper for us.”
</p>
<p>“We need advertising and publicity both,” Scoop waggled. “What we want to do, to make
a success of our show,” he added, businesslike, “is to get everybody in town to talking
about us. And to do that we’ve got to advertise, and we’ve got to have the newspaper
further recognize us and print more news about us. <i>Publicity</i> news. A lot of people will laugh at the idea of four boys starting a boat show, and
maybe they won’t pay any attention to us at the start. But after a day or two, knowing
that we are still in business, they’ll begin to wonder if our show isn’t of some account
after all. They’ll get curious to see it. And then, when they come to the boat to
satisfy their curiosity, we’ll get their money. See?”
</p>
<p>I had to admit to myself that Scoop was pretty smart.
</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t it be darby,” I said, “if we could <span class="pageNum" id="pb35">[<a href="#pb35">35</a>]</span>hitch an engine to our boat, as the newspaper says. We could ride our audience up
the canal, instead of giving our show here at the dock.”
</p>
<p>Scoop scratched his head.
</p>
<p>“That would be a slick stunt.”
</p>
<p>“Let’s do it,” I urged.
</p>
<p>“Where are we going to get the necessary engine?”
</p>
<p>“The junk yard,” I told him, “is full of old auto engines. For the biggest part of
Mr. Solbeam’s business is junking cars. Tommy Hegan bought an engine from him for
ten dollars. It runs, too.”
</p>
<p>Determined, on more lengthy conversation, in which our other two chums took part,
to see what we could do in the way of supplying our show boat with an engine, Scoop
and I and Red went to the junk yard, leaving Peg on guard at the dock. As I had told
Scoop, there were dozens of old auto engines in the yard. We looked them over, picking
out the one that we wanted. Then we had a talk with the proprietor.
</p>
<p>“Ya,” he said, working his shoulders and screwing up his hairy face, “I sell heem
vor a ten dollah. O, ya, ya,” he flourished, “heem vork. Fine, fine. An’ a beeg bargain,
boys; a beeg bargain.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb36">[<a href="#pb36">36</a>]</span></p>
<p>Scoop looked around the cluttered junk yard.
</p>
<p>“What’ll you give us,” he asked, to a point, “if we straighten up this mess for you?”
</p>
<p>“Vot’s dat?”
</p>
<p>“We’ll work for you for the rest of the day, the three of us, if you’ll sell us the
engine for three dollars. Is it a deal?”
</p>
<p>The junk man scowled. I thought at first that he was going to order us out of the
yard. But I was to learn that scowling was just a trick of his. He had to scowl and
work his shoulders and flourish his hands in order to talk business.
</p>
<p>“I tell you vot, boys, you vork it two days an’ not vun day an’ I sell you heem vor
dree dollahs.”
</p>
<p>“No,” waggled Scoop, who realized that the other was trying to get the big end of
the bargain.
</p>
<p>The junk man next offered the engine to us for one day’s work and five dollars.
</p>
<p>“No,” Scoop said again. “We made you our offer. You can take it or leave it.”
</p>
<p>“Vell,” shrugged the junk man, with a trace of a grin on his face, “you gif me da
dree dollahs, an’ with da day’s vork ve vill call it a deal.”
</p>
<p>Cleaning up that junk yard was the hardest work I ever did. And as I tugged and lugged
I told myself that when I grew up the one thing <span class="pageNum" id="pb37">[<a href="#pb37">37</a>]</span>that I wasn’t going to be was a junk wrestler. By ten o’clock my arms were so lame
that it pained me to lift them. I couldn’t step around half as briskly as I had done
at the start. I suggested to the other fellows, who were equally as tired as I was,
that we better stop and rest. And with Mr. Solbeam’s consent we sent Red home for
some sandwiches and doughnuts.
</p>
<p>I was glad when the noon whistles blew. As I hurried into the street Dad drove by
in our auto, stopping at my signal.
</p>
<p>“I never saw you look any dirtier,” he grinned, “so you ought to be happy.”
</p>
<p>I told him what I had been doing.
</p>
<p>“Hard work, hey?” and he looked at me sort of warm-like.
</p>
<p>“I’ll tell the world it’s hard work,” Red piped up from the back of the car, where
he was stretched full length on the seat.
</p>
<p>“Well,” grinned Dad, “anything worth having is worth working for.” After which little
sermon he inquired how the show business was coming along, asking particularly if
we had received any congratulatory professional telegrams from P.&nbsp;T. Barnum or Al
Ringling.
</p>
<p>We would soon open up for business, I told him, paying no attention to his nonsense
about the <span class="pageNum" id="pb38">[<a href="#pb38">38</a>]</span>telegrams. Our big job now, I explained, was to get the engine to working and rig
up some kind of a propeller.
</p>
<p>“I suppose you’re incorporated,” he said, further joshing me.
</p>
<p>“Ask Scoop,” I grinned. “He’s the manager.”
</p>
<p>“Well, I hope that he proves to be a better manager than he did the night that he
had the fire department squirting water on the Meyers’ barn.”
</p>
<p>“Scoop’s all right,” I waggled.
</p>
<p>That afternoon the thermometer went up to something like one hundred degrees in the
shade, only we didn’t know much about what it was like in the shade for the junk that
we were working on was piled in the middle of the yard where there were no trees.
We lugged castings and steel bars and other stuff around until it seemed to me as
though the muscles of my arms would crack and curl up. I never was so dog-gone tired
in all my life. But we made progress. The pile of stuff in the middle of the yard
began to look more orderly. We put the cast iron in one pile and the steel pieces
in another pile. The brass stuff went into a box. Mr. Solbeam explained to us that
the brass was worth more than the iron and steel, and at his orders we dragged the
box to a <span class="pageNum" id="pb39">[<a href="#pb39">39</a>]</span>shed, the door of which was fitted with a padlock.
</p>
<p>The shed, we found, was cluttered with all kinds of odd and interesting things that
the junk man had bought, in the probable thought that he would be able to resell the
stuff and make a profit.
</p>
<p>“What the dickens?…” yipped Scoop. “Here’s some pieces of a merry-go-round. Look at
the wooden horses! Some with three legs and some with two legs and some with only
one leg. Here’s one without a head.”
</p>
<p>“And here’s the merry-go-round organ,” yipped Red, from his side of the shed.
</p>
<p>“Wind it up,” I laughed, “and see if it’ll play a tune.”
</p>
<p>Scoop came on the run.
</p>
<p>“Hot dog!” he cried, sort of draping himself over the dusty organ. “It’s just what
we need for our show.”
</p>
<p>Mr. Solbeam was out in front talking loudly to a deaf old man who had just brought
a load of rags into the yard.
</p>
<p>“I’m going to tackle him,” cried Scoop, “and see what he wants for the organ.”
</p>
<p>Excited over our find, Red and I quite forgot about our tired arms and legs. We dragged
the organ clear of the stuff that had been piled on top of it and dusted it off. It
sure was a hard-looker. <span class="pageNum" id="pb40">[<a href="#pb40">40</a>]</span>As the saying is, it had seen better days. But we didn’t care how rickety it was if
it would make music. There was a little image on top that was supposed to beat a metal
jigger. But it didn’t work. When Red turned the crank the image just jiggled its arm,
as though it had a bad case of frazzled nerves.
</p>
<p>“Lookit!” I cried, pointing to the organ’s name. “O-r-c-h-e-s-t-r-e-l-l-e,” I spelt.
</p>
<p>“I thought it was a hand organ,” Red said, disappointed.
</p>
<p>“It is a hand organ,” I grinned. “A plain old hand organ with a fancy name. But that’s
all the better,” I waggled. “For we can print the name in our advertising. It’ll sound
big. Turn the crank some more,” I instructed. “Let’s see if it’s got any tunes hid
away in its ribs.”
</p>
<p>The organ, under Red’s spirited winding, let out some awful groans and squeaks. It
wheezed and puffed, acting for all the world as though it was gagging on a fish bone
or had a hot potato in its musical mouth.
</p>
<p>“It needs oiling,” panted Red, straightening and rubbing his back.
</p>
<p>Here Scoop came on the run.
</p>
<p>“It took two dollars to buy it,” he told us, “but it’s worth it. He asked twenty dollars
at the <span class="pageNum" id="pb41">[<a href="#pb41">41</a>]</span>start. But I talked him down. He probably was glad to get the two cart wheels. For
he wouldn’t have many chances to sell a thing like this.”
</p>
<p>“We may be throwing our money away,” I said. “For Red has been twisting its tail for
five minutes, trying to tame it, and it hasn’t done anything except stutter.”
</p>
<p>“Oh,” cried Scoop, pleased with his purchase, “we can make it play. I’m not worried
about that.”
</p>
<p>It was our plan to haul the heavy engine to the scow the following morning in Scoop’s
delivery wagon. But in our eagerness to explore the inside of our organ, we took it
away with us at the close of our day’s work, carting it down the street on one of
Mr. Solbeam’s wabbly wheelbarrows.
</p>
<p>It was agreed among us that we were to meet at Red’s house, directly after supper,
to find out what was inside of the hand organ and sort of get on the good side of
it. Not knowing how many tunes it had, or what they were like, filled us with excitement.
</p>
<p>At Red’s suggestion we went up the alley as we approached his house. This was to avoid
attention. Putting the organ in the barn, we separated.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I had a cold supper. For Mother was away from home.
</p>
<p>“It must be the regular afternoon meeting of the Stitch and Chatter Club,” joked Dad,
grinning at me across the table.
</p>
<p>Having dirtied only a few dishes, we put these in a pan in the kitchen sink; then
I hurried over to Red’s barn with a screw driver and a handful of wrenches.
</p>
<p>Scoop didn’t show up for ten or fifteen minutes, having been to the dock where Peg
was still on guard.
</p>
<p>“Too bad,” I said to Scoop, “that Peg can’t be here.”
</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s worrying him,” the leader grinned. “For I found him with his nose
in your ‘Waltzing Hen’ book when I took his supper over to him. He seemed to be perfectly
contented.”
</p>
<p>“He’s had the soft part of it to-day,” spoke up Red, thinking of our hard work in
the junk yard.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb43">[<a href="#pb43">43</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Did I tell you,” Scoop inquired of the freckled one, “that he’s going to take your
place to-night?”
</p>
<p>“What’s the idea?”
</p>
<p>“He thinks he can solve the mystery of the whispering ghost.”
</p>
<p>Red shivered.
</p>
<p>“I’ll think twice before <i>I</i> ever put in a night on that spooky old boat.”
</p>
<p>We pulled the hand organ into the middle of the barn floor and removed its wooden
top.
</p>
<p>Red squinted inside.
</p>
<p>“Phew!” he sniffed. “It smells like an old mouse trap.”
</p>
<p>There was a burst of laughter from the house and the clatter of dishes.
</p>
<p>“What’s going on in there?” I inquired of Red.
</p>
<p>“Oh, Ma’s entertaining the stitchers and chatterers. Hand me the oil can.”
</p>
<p>There was a lot of wheels and queer-shaped jiggers inside of the organ. We didn’t
know what they were for. But, as they looked kind of rusty, we cleaned them with an
old shirt of Red’s and gave them a liberal oiling. There was no squeaking now when
we turned the crank. Nor was there, to our disappointment, any music.
</p>
<p>Red was in his glory. For he loves to tinker with machinery. About every so often
he takes <span class="pageNum" id="pb44">[<a href="#pb44">44</a>]</span>the family clock to pieces. One time he whittled out a repeating rig-a-jig for his
mother’s talking machine and ruined ten dollars’ worth of choice records.
</p>
<p>His freckled nose deep in the organ’s chamber, he suddenly let out a yip.
</p>
<p>“Here’s a clutch, fellows! That’s why it wouldn’t play. It wasn’t in gear. Try it
now.”
</p>
<p>Scoop grabbed the crank and started winding. There was a lot of wheezes and groans
inside of the organ. Then it gave a sudden loud blat.
</p>
<p>“Turn faster,” danced Red, the oil can in one hand and the screw driver in the other.
“It’s getting ready to play a tune.”
</p>
<p>Scoop turned for dear life. And after a bad coughing spell, the organ settled down
to business.
</p>
<p>“What’d I tell you?” cried Red. “It’s playing a tune.”
</p>
<p>“What tune is it?” I grinned.
</p>
<p>“Sounds like ‘The Old Oaken Bucket.’ Maybe, though, it’s something else. Anyway, it’s
a <i>tune</i>. So why should we worry what it is?”
</p>
<p>“I know what tune it is,” I joked. “It’s the one the old cat died on.”
</p>
<p>Scoop continued to twist the organ’s tail until <span class="pageNum" id="pb45">[<a href="#pb45">45</a>]</span>he was blue in the face. Red then took a hand at it. The organ waded through the “bucket”
tune, or whatever piece it was, and gurgled out the chorus of “A Hot Time in the Old
Town To-night.”
</p>
<p>“It’s getting more up-to-date every minute,” laughed Scoop. “Step on it, Red. Atta-boy!
Here comes ‘After the Ball.’ ”
</p>
<p>Red was out of wind.
</p>
<p>“It’s your turn,” he panted, beckoning to me.
</p>
<p>Under my spirited turning, the organ developed a hemorrhage in its left lung. “B-r-r-r-E-r-r-r-B-r-r-r!”
it gurgled.
</p>
<p>“It’s dying,” shrieked Red.
</p>
<p>As though to prove to us that the freckled one didn’t know what he was talking about,
the organ took the bit in its teeth, so to speak, and came out strong with “Sweet
Rosie O’Grady.” Our leader knew the words to the old song. But he had to yell, let
me tell you, to make himself heard. For that old organ was bellowing like a mad bull.
</p>
<p>Red and I joined in, going “Da-da-da,” for we didn’t know the words. We kept getting
louder and louder, only I couldn’t yell as loud as the others. The cranking job took
a lot of my wind.
</p>
<p>All of a sudden Red’s mother bounded into the barn.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb46">[<a href="#pb46">46</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Stop it!” she cried, her fingers in her ears. “Stop it!”
</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” grinned Scoop, when the organ had expired. “Don’t you like music,
Mrs. Meyers?”
</p>
<p>“Yes, I like <i>music</i>. I thought it was Donald screaming for help.” She pressed a hand to her heart and
drew a deep breath. “Such a scare as I had.” She came closer and gave the organ a
puzzled glance. “What in the world is it?—a hand organ?”
</p>
<p>“It’s an orchestrelle,” I grinned, remembering the organ’s fancy name.
</p>
<p>“It’s a part of our show,” Red spoke up, glowing with pride. Then he told his mother
about the merry-go-round in Mr. Solbeam’s shed.
</p>
<p>“It’s a wonder to me,” she said stiffly, “that you didn’t lug the whole merry-go-round
home, while you were about it.”
</p>
<p>Mother came into sight in the barn door.
</p>
<p>“See what our sons and heirs have dragged home from somebody’s ash pile,” pointed
Mrs. Meyers. “A hand organ,” she added, and from the way she said it you could have
imagined that our fine organ was a cross-eyed flea on a shunned alley cat.
</p>
<p>I didn’t blame Red for stiffening.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb47">[<a href="#pb47">47</a>]</span></p>
<p>“How do you get that way?” he cried, scowling. “We paid two dollars for it. It’s a
good organ, too. I like it better than our old piano.”
</p>
<p>Some more curious-eyed members of the Stitch and Chatter Club came into sight.
</p>
<p>“Was Donald hurt, Mrs. Meyers?”
</p>
<p>“Aw!…” scowled Red. “We aren’t giving a party.”
</p>
<p>“<i>I</i> am,” his mother said quickly. “And I want you to stop this horrible racket. We can’t
hear ourselves think. And people are stopping in the street and staring at the house.”
</p>
<p>Red angrily jerked Mr. Solbeam’s bow-legged wheelbarrow into sight.
</p>
<p>“A fellow can’t have any fun around here at all. No, he can’t. Take hold of it,” he
growled at Scoop, “and help me put it on the wheelbarrow. We’ll take it down to our
boat, where we can play it without being jawed at. Huh!”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb48">[<a href="#pb48">48</a>]</span></p>

<h2 class="main">UNDER POWER</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The next morning I was so stiff that I hated the thought of getting up. But I managed
to drag myself out of bed in time to have breakfast with Dad and Mother. They were
laughing and talking as I limped down the stairs, rubbing my eyes and carefully stretching.
I heard Mother say something about an organ. She quit talking when I came into the
room. Dad was grinning. When breakfast was over I rode with him to the brickyard,
hurrying to the boat to relieve Scoop and Peg.
</p>
<p>“Well,” I grinned at the hungry ones, “did you entertain the whispering ghost last
night with some choice hand organ selections?”
</p>
<p>Peg shook his head.
</p>
<p>“Nothing happened all night long,” he told me, disappointed.
</p>
<p>At eight-thirty Scoop drove to the dock with the engine. We had a time unloading it.
And when we finally got it into the boat we despaired <span class="pageNum" id="pb49">[<a href="#pb49">49</a>]</span>for a time of ever being able to use it. We moved it this way and that way, trying
various schemes. But we didn’t get anywhere.
</p>
<p>The trouble was we had no way of getting our power <i>into</i> the water. It was no particular trick to set up the engine—that part of the task
gave us no concern; but it <i>was</i> a trick, let me tell you, to figure out a practical propeller.
</p>
<p>We finally decided that we would have to buy a drive shaft from Mr. Solbeam. This
cost us another fifty cents. Our thirty dollars, I told Scoop, was going fast. We
had spent five dollars and fifty cents.
</p>
<p>“That’s all right,” he said easily. “We should expect to pay out our working capital.
That’s what it’s for.”
</p>
<p>“I’ll be glad,” I said, “when the money starts coming in.”
</p>
<p>“The engine scheme,” he said, “is going to put us back a day or two. But it’s better,
<i>I</i> think, to be a day or so behind, and do the thing right, than to start up in a hurry
and make a halfway job of it.”
</p>
<p>After a lot of puzzling work we finally got our engine bolted in position on the rear
deck, to one side of the big rudder. Of course, it would have been better if we could
have positioned the engine <span class="pageNum" id="pb50">[<a href="#pb50">50</a>]</span>in the center of the deck where the rudder was. But that was out of the question.
</p>
<p>We let our freckled chum do the most of the planning. For he seemed to have better
ideas than any of the rest of us. He was already calling himself the “engineer.”
</p>
<p>We made a two-blade propeller out of wood, clamping it on the lower end of the drive
shaft, which had been given a braced bearing just above the water.
</p>
<p>It took us a full half hour to get the engine started. I cranked and Scoop cranked
and Peg cranked. When it did start it smoked worse than old Paddy Gorbett’s kitchen
chimney. But Red said that was a good thing—it proved that the engine was getting
plenty of oil.
</p>
<p>“I can hear a knock,” Scoop said, listening.
</p>
<p>“What do you expect for three dollars?” grunted Red, sticking up for his pet. “That
knock won’t hurt anything. Forget it.”
</p>
<p>We loosened the <i>Sally Ann</i> and the engineer shoved the gear-box lever into “low,” thus putting the propeller
shaft into slow motion.
</p>
<p>“Hurray!” yipped Scoop, throwing his cap into the air. “We’re moving!”
</p>
<p>Red slipped the propeller into high gear.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb51">[<a href="#pb51">51</a>]</span></p>
<p>“She’s working as slick as a button,” he shrieked above the engine’s roar.
</p>
<p>“Some class to us,” yipped Peg, cocking his cap on one ear and posing, skipper-like,
against the tiller.
</p>
<p>“Watch your job,” I laughed, giving the tiller a jerk. “You almost ran us into the
bank.”
</p>
<p>“Let’s try backing up,” suggested Scoop.
</p>
<p>Red pushed the lever into “reverse.” Slowly the <i>Sally Ann</i> came to a stop, then began to back up.
</p>
<p>“Shove her into ‘forward,’ ” Scoop directed, “and we’ll take a trip down the canal.”
</p>
<p>We went about a mile. Several times the engine stuttered and gagged, but that was
nothing to worry about, Red said. Coming home we had to back up, for there wasn’t
enough room in the canal for us to turn around. But to us the backing up was just
as much fun as going ahead. We told ourselves that we were pretty smart. Not many
boys our age could have done a job like this. And what did we care if it took us an
hour to go a couple of miles? The <i>Sally Ann</i> was moving under her own power, and that was the main thing. We would have no trouble
getting over to Ashton and back. The county seat was separated <span class="pageNum" id="pb52">[<a href="#pb52">52</a>]</span>from Tutter by only a few miles. We could make an all-day trip of it, if necessary.
A thing we weren’t short of was time.
</p>
<p>To save ourselves the tiresome work of cranking the hand organ, we made a wooden pulley,
to take the place of the crank, and ran a belt from the pulley to the engine. By speeding
the engine we could make “The Old Oaken Bucket” sound like a jazzy fox trot.
</p>
<p>It was now well along toward suppertime. So Scoop remained at the boat while the rest
of us went home to eat. That night Peg and I stood guard, sleeping turn about. But
there was no disturbance throughout the night. We saw nothing of either the whispering
ghost or the tricky Stricker gang.
</p>
<p>Scoop relieved us at six o’clock. And after breakfast the leader and I went to the
<i>Daily Globe</i> office to order our tickets.
</p>
<p>These would be ready for us at noon, we were told, and would cost us a dollar.
</p>
<p>“Maybe,” Scoop said to the editor, giving me a nudge, “you’d like to have some more
news about our show.”
</p>
<p>The man laughed and brought out his pencil.
</p>
<p>“We’re going to open up to-night.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb53">[<a href="#pb53">53</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Fine!”
</p>
<p>“Our show is going to be a humdinger. Music and everything.”
</p>
<p>“Music? Some one going to play a mouth organ?”
</p>
<p>“No. We’ve bought an orchestrelle.”
</p>
<p>“A which?”
</p>
<p>“An orchestrelle,” Scoop repeated, grinning.
</p>
<p>“How do you spell it?”
</p>
<p>“Evidently,” Scoop joked, “you aren’t very well posted on the better class of musical
instruments.”
</p>
<p>“That,” sighed Mr. Stair, in pretended depression, “is one of the tragedies of my
life. I’m on speaking terms with a jew’s-harp; but that’s the extent of my musical
education, so to speak. Does this rig-a-ma-jig of yours start with an ‘a’ or an ‘o’?”
</p>
<p>“O-r-c-h-e-s-t-r-e-l-l-e,” spelt Scoop. It surprised me that he didn’t get some of
the letters twisted around. For he’s the poorest speller in our class. I’m one of
the best.
</p>
<p>“Who plays it?” the editor wanted to know.
</p>
<p>“It plays itself—it’s automatic.”
</p>
<p>Mr. Stair laughed when we told him about our engine.
</p>
<p>“We wouldn’t have thought of it,” admitted <span class="pageNum" id="pb54">[<a href="#pb54">54</a>]</span>Scoop, “if you hadn’t mentioned it in your newspaper.”
</p>
<p>“Are you going to go over to Ashton with your show?”
</p>
<p>“Maybe.”
</p>
<p>An inquiry was then made of the editor regarding the cost of advertising in his newspaper.
</p>
<p>“Our regular rate,” he informed, “is twenty cents a column inch. For two dollars,
which will give you five inches, double column, you can make quite a showing. Is your
copy ready?”
</p>
<p>“It will be,” Scoop grinned, “in ten jerks of a lamb’s tail.”
</p>
<p>Here is the advertisement that he wrote, after considerable changing and erasing:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first center"><i>WORLD’S GREATEST BLACK ART SHOW OPENS TO-NIGHT</i>

</p>
<p>Pretty soon we were in the street, headed for the show boat.
</p>
<p>“This afternoon,” Scoop planned, “we’ll have a rehearsal; then we’ll start the engine
and run the <i>Sally Ann</i> to the central bridge dock. If we play the organ we’ll attract a lot of attention.
People will come running to find out what’s going on. Then they’ll see our ad in to-night’s
paper. That’ll bring them out.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb56">[<a href="#pb56">56</a>]</span></p>

<div id="ch7" class="div1 chapter"><span class="pageNum">[<a href="#xd31e366">Contents</a>]</span><div class="divHead">
<h2 class="label">CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h2 class="main">OUR FIRST SHOW</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In line with our leader’s plans, we had a rehearsal that afternoon, running the show
boat a short distance out of town, so that we could do our rehearsing undisturbed.
</p>
<p>Of course, we couldn’t put on the regular show, as it had to be dark to do that. But
Scoop dressed in his magician’s suit of white cloth and Peg and I, who worked on the
stage as unseen assistants, put on our black suits.
</p>
<p>The reason why we were invisible to the audience was because everything back of us
on the stage was black. Scoop could be seen because he was dressed in white, with
his face and hair powdered white. Lights arranged up and down the sides of the stage,
reflected into the audience, dazzled the spectators. Looking into these lights, they
could see nothing on the stage that wasn’t white. Dressed in black, a black veil over
our faces, Peg and I could move here and there without detection.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb57">[<a href="#pb57">57</a>]</span></p>
<p>The trick consisted of making tables, pitchers, cups and white things like that appear
and disappear in a most surprising way. It was an easy trick to perform when one had
the necessary stuff. We would have a white table behind a black screen and when we
wanted the table to “appear,” Scoop, as the magician, would wave his wand and Peg
or I, whoever had hold of the screen, would jerk it away, thus bringing the table,
in a flash, into sight of the audience.
</p>
<p>Scoop would make pitchers and cups appear and disappear on the white table. To do
this, Peg or I would bring the necessary pitcher on the stage, keeping the white article
out of sight behind a small black screen. Then we would rest the screen on the table
top, with the white pitcher behind it, jerking the screen away at Scoop’s signal,
thus making the pitcher “appear.” In the same way we could make cups and saucers appear
and disappear—any number of times. We could make white flowers grow out of white flower
pots; produce white rabbits from small white cups. By dangling a white ball on the
end of a black string, we could make it do many surprising things.
</p>
<p>Probably the best trick of all was what we called the “Living Head.” We had a wooden
<span class="pageNum" id="pb58">[<a href="#pb58">58</a>]</span>platter, painted white, made so that I could slide my chin over the back edge. To
the audience it appeared that my head was resting on the platter. Scoop would carry
the platter across the stage, and, of course, I would walk under the platter, for
I had to go wherever my head went. To do this trick I had to powder my face white,
like Scoop’s, and in the trick, to get a laugh, I was supposed to wink and yawn, sort
of droll-like. By keeping my black suit on from my neck down, the audience couldn’t
see anything of me except my white head.
</p>
<p>Following our rehearsal we ran the <i>Sally Ann</i> to the dock at the central bridge. A lot of kids gathered on the bridge, among them
the Striker gang. When we started our hand organ, practically all of Main Street came
running to see what was going on.
</p>
<p>Red’s big sister came along with some stylish girl friends. But she didn’t stay very
long. I guess the sight of Red hurt her pride. Seated on the edge of the ticket stand,
megaphone in hand, he was having the time of his life.
</p>
<p>“La-adies and gents,” he yipped, “don’t forget the bi-ig show to-night. See Kermann,
the great hoodoo magician, who has appeared before all of the crowned heads of Europe.
Remember the <span class="pageNum" id="pb59">[<a href="#pb59">59</a>]</span>bi-ig show to-night at eight-thirty. O-only fifteen cents admission. Ten cents for
kids.”
</p>
<p>“That’s the kind of stuff to hand them,” grinned Scoop, “only don’t call me a ‘hoodoo’
magician. It’s ‘Hindu’ and not ‘hoodoo.’ ”
</p>
<p>We could see that the Strickers were jealous of us. They had their heads together,
whispering and pointing. I could imagine how cheap they felt. They had tried to bust
up our show, but we had been too smart for them.
</p>
<p>That evening at the supper table I inquired of Dad if he and Mother were planning
to attend our show.
</p>
<p>“I should snicker,” he winked. “We wouldn’t miss it for a panful of pickled pretzels.”
</p>
<p>“Thirty cents,” I checked off in my mind. A hundred families at thirty cents apiece
would be thirty dollars. Hot dog! I could see where we were going to make a barrel
of money, all right.
</p>
<p>Hurrying back to the boat, where Peg was on guard, I met Scoop, whose arms were full
of packages and paper bags.
</p>
<p>“Stuff to eat,” he told me.
</p>
<p>“Are you going to serve refreshments during the show?” I grinned.
</p>
<p>“Hardly. But if we expect to go to Ashton with our show, we might as well start living
on <span class="pageNum" id="pb60">[<a href="#pb60">60</a>]</span>the boat first as last. It’ll be fun. To-morrow Pa is going to send down a boiled
ham and a bag of potatoes. This is stuff I got at the store for breakfast.”
</p>
<p>It began to get dark shortly after eight o’clock, so we lit the big lamp near the
ticket stand and the dazzle lamps on the sides of the stage. Red had five dollars’
worth of change handy. He was impatient to begin selling tickets. We were impatient
to have him begin—we wanted to see the money pile up in the change box. But, of course,
we had to wait with our ticket selling until it was dark enough to go ahead with our
show.
</p>
<p>People began to gather on the dock, talking and laughing. Scoop’s father and mother
were there and so was Peg’s folks. I could see a number of our neighbors in Dad’s
party. There was a lot of jolly talk. Dad was cutting up. He was a whole show in himself.
Golly Ned! The older I grow the bigger my love gets for my swell dad.
</p>
<p>Well, about eight-fifteen Red opened the gate and the waiting kids and the grown people
filed past the ticket stand, handing the ticket seller their money. In no time at
all the seats were all filled. Dad and Mother were up in front with Red’s mother.
Mr. Meyers couldn’t come, because, <span class="pageNum" id="pb61">[<a href="#pb61">61</a>]</span>as owner of the Lyric theater, he had to work.
</p>
<p>Selling his last ticket, Red shut the gate, setting the boat free of its tie ropes.
Pretty soon the scow was moving slowly down the canal.
</p>
<p>Scoop was behind the big black screen, and at his signal we jerked the screen away,
making him “appear.” He bowed and everybody clapped their hands.
</p>
<p>Having carefully rehearsed our parts we knew just what to do and when to do it. Everything
went off fine. We made two tables appear, one on each side of the stage. Then we made
a pitcher appear on one table and a flower pot on the other. In the course of the
performance I went back of the curtain to prepare myself for the “Living Head” trick.
</p>
<p>Scoop told the audience that he would now perform his greatest feat. That was my cue.
Putting a black screen in front of my powdered head, so that I wouldn’t be seen, I
slipped my chin over the edge of the white wooden platter. Scoop waved his wand and
Peg jerked away the screen.
</p>
<p>There was a ripple of laughter.
</p>
<p>“Hi, Jerry!” some kid in the audience called out.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb62">[<a href="#pb62">62</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Who cut your head off, Jerry?” another yelled.
</p>
<p>“It can’t be Jerry,” I heard Dad say, “because it looks too clean.”
</p>
<p>I grinned.
</p>
<p>“Cut it out,” Scoop hissed. “You aren’t supposed to be alive yet.”
</p>
<p>So I shut my eyes and drew down my face, sober-like, which set everybody to laughing
again. You can see I was good.
</p>
<p>Scoop went on with his performance. And at the proper time, at his command, I slowly
opened my eyes. As I did so I felt something touring around on the back of my neck.
I hadn’t any doubt what it was, for the air was full of pinch bugs. Not small ones,
but the big kind, that sort of swoop down on a fellow and grab a hunk of skin and
start gnawing. I tried to wriggle my neck, to make the bug fly away. But it hung on
like a plaster.
</p>
<p>“<i>Ouch!</i>” I screeched, when the hungry skin eater had started in on his supper.
</p>
<p>The audience roared. It probably did look funny to them; but, let me tell you, it
wasn’t funny to me.
</p>
<p>Scoop stepped to the front of the stage.
</p>
<p>“Ladies and gentlemen,” he grinned, “our ‘Living <span class="pageNum" id="pb63">[<a href="#pb63">63</a>]</span>Head’ has been punctured by a pinch bug, so we will have to end the show and send
for a plumber.”
</p>
<p>We had carefully instructed Red that he was to reverse the propeller at a certain
point in the show, timing our excursion so that we would get back to the dock at nine
o’clock, a few minutes after the show came to an end.
</p>
<p>So, as I left the stage, rubbing the back of my neck, I had no other thought than
that we were within sight of the dock. Consider my surprise, therefore, to learn that
we were still a half mile in the country.
</p>
<p>Getting out of my suit I hurried to the rear deck to see if Red needed help.
</p>
<p>“Something’s wrong,” he told me, turning a pair of anxious eyes on me.
</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”
</p>
<p>“We don’t move. See?” and he pointed to the trees that grew along the canal bank.
</p>
<p>He was right. The engine was working; the propeller was churning; but the boat wasn’t
moving a hair.
</p>
<p>“Everything was working slick,” he said. “Then, all of a sudden, the boat stopped
dead still. That was five—ten minutes ago. Since then we haven’t moved an inch.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb64">[<a href="#pb64">64</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Maybe we’re on a sand bar.”
</p>
<p>“It acts to me as though the blamed boat is bewitched.”
</p>
<p>He was thinking of the whispering ghost.
</p>
<p>“When do we go home?” a voice in the audience called out good-naturedly.
</p>
<p>“Pretty quick,” I called back.
</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” Scoop inquired, appearing at my elbow.
</p>
<p>I told him that we weren’t moving.
</p>
<p>“The propeller’s turning,” he said, looking into the water.
</p>
<p>“Sure thing. But the boat is standing still.”
</p>
<p>“Something’s got hold of it,” spoke up Red.
</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Scoop inquired sharply.
</p>
<p>“He thinks it’s the ghost,” I put in.
</p>
<p>“Bunk! I’d sooner think it’s a trick of the Strickers.”
</p>
<p>“But how——” I began.
</p>
<p>My words broke off sharply as something struck me on the leg and rattled to the deck.
Stooping, I picked up a small metal washer. There was a rolled-up note in the disc’s
bore.
</p>
<p>Here is what I read:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">There is a rope stretched across the canal.
</p>
<p class="signed"><span class="sc">The Friendly Ghost.</span></p>
</blockquote><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb65">[<a href="#pb65">65</a>]</span></p>
<p>Well, when we got back to town, after having cut the Strickers’ rope, we tried to
figure out among ourselves who the friendly ghost was. That it was a man, we could
not doubt. The note had been tossed to us out of the darkness. Obviously the “ghost”
had been close to our boat, probably in a boat of his own. Yet we had seen no small
boat in the canal.
</p>
<p>Who was he? Why was he taking sides with us against the Strickers? Was he constantly
keeping near us? It would seem so. Even as we discussed the mystery, he probably was
within hearing of our voices.
</p>
<p>But why had he, a man, signed himself “The Friendly Ghost”? Did he intend that we
should believe that he <i>was</i> a ghost?
</p>
<p>In a vague way we had the feeling that there was a hidden connection between our show
and the unknown man’s visit to the boat the night the Strickers had sought to destroy
our stuff. It was because of our show that he was keeping near us … watching us.
</p>
<p>What we didn’t suspect was the startling adventure that lay ahead of us as showmen.
We realized that we were involved in a mystery; but, for the most part, it seemed
to be a rather commonplace affair. It puzzled us but didn’t excite <span class="pageNum" id="pb66">[<a href="#pb66">66</a>]</span>us. We little dreamed, as I say, of what was coming.
</p>
<p>After a while we gave our attention to other things of importance to us, for we seemed
to make no progress in our discussion of the “ghost.”
</p>
<p>Red had sold thirty fifteen-cent tickets and twenty-five ten-cent tickets. As a result,
we were richer by seven dollars. I had expected to make more. But I wasn’t dissatisfied.
For I realized now that I had been too enthusiastic. As a matter of fact, seven dollars
was good pay for our work.
</p>
<p>“If we can do this well all through vacation,” Red said, looking ahead, “we’ll take
in four or five hundred dollars. Whoopee!”
</p>
<p>“Let’s send up town and get some ice cream and celebrate,” suggested Peg.
</p>
<p>“I second the motion,” laughed Scoop. “Hey, Jerry, ol’ money bag, separate yourself
from fifty cents. We’re going to have a party.”
</p>
<p>The ice cream put away inside of our stomachs, we went to bed, between ten and eleven
o’clock, three of us sleeping and the fourth standing guard. I was a long time getting
to sleep. I kept thinking of the money that we were going to earn and the good time
that we were going to have. When I finally got to sleep I dreamt that <span class="pageNum" id="pb67">[<a href="#pb67">67</a>]</span>I was sitting on an ice cream cone a mile high. Five-dollar bills were flying around
my head like birds.
</p>
<p>“Cut it out!” Scoop growled, giving me a dig in the ribs.
</p>
<p>In grabbing at the flying greenbacks, I had pinched his nose!

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The next morning when we were eating breakfast, after an uneventful night, Dad came
whistling to the brickyard dock to learn how we were getting along.
</p>
<p>This was a good time, I thought, to sort of feel him out on our proposed Ashton trip.
</p>
<p>“We’ll soon be going camping,” I told him, getting at my subject in a roundabout way.
</p>
<p>“I wish I could go with you,” he grinned, helping himself to one of our doughnuts.
</p>
<p>“We’ll let you,” Scoop put in quickly.
</p>
<p>“No chance,” Dad sighed. “I’ve got to keep my nose to the grindstone.”
</p>
<p>“We won’t have to bother you this year,” I went on, “to haul our truck up the canal
in the car. For we’re going to use our boat.”
</p>
<p>“<i>This</i> boat?”
</p>
<p>“Sure thing. We probably can earn some money, too.”
</p>
<p>“Taking passengers?”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb69">[<a href="#pb69">69</a>]</span></p>
<p>“If we camp on Oak Island,” I said, “we can stop at Ashton on the way to the wide
waters and give our show. And once we get to the island, it isn’t so very far to Steam
Corners.”
</p>
<p>“You better hire a mule,” Dad laughed.
</p>
<p>“What for?”
</p>
<p>“This engine of yours will never carry you that far.”
</p>
<p>“Hey!” yipped Red, grinning. “Don’t you run down our swell engine.”
</p>
<p>“It’s an old engine and liable to go blooey at any minute. I wouldn’t trust it two
miles, myself.”
</p>
<p>“If it breaks down,” boasted Red, “I can fix it.”
</p>
<p>In our further talk, Dad made it plain to us that he wasn’t keen about letting us
start out in the scow. He couldn’t bring himself to believe, he said, serious, that
we would be able to go very many miles without a serious breakdown.
</p>
<p>But he had promised to let me go camping when the other fellows went. And, as they
had gained their parents’ consent to the trip, he couldn’t very well say “no” to me
without backing down on his word.
</p>
<p>So I finally got his reluctant consent.
</p>
<p>That day we put a bigger advertisement in the <span class="pageNum" id="pb70">[<a href="#pb70">70</a>]</span><i>Daily Globe</i>, for the coming show was to be our last one in Tutter until we had returned from
our out-of-town trip. When the advertising bill had been paid, I sort of balanced
my accounts, if that is the way to express it. Here is the way my figures looked on
paper:

</p>
<p>That afternoon we started the engine and turned on the organ to let the townsfolk
know that we were still on the job. Red told us that the engine was burning a lot
of gasoline. We didn’t let that worry us, for Scoop was getting the gasoline for nothing
at his father’s store. In preparing for our trip, the leader filled three five-gallon
cans. There was another fifteen gallons <span class="pageNum" id="pb71">[<a href="#pb71">71</a>]</span>in the engine tank, so we figured that we wouldn’t have to spend any of our working
capital for gasoline for several days. By that time we probably would be rolling in
money.
</p>
<p>There wasn’t such a big crowd at our show that night. The older people, for the most
part, didn’t seem to be greatly interested in our performance. But we took in four
dollars, the most of it in ten-cent admissions. Mother and Dad were there. I talked
with them just before the show started.
</p>
<p>“Have a good time,” Mother told me, referring to our camping trip, “but be careful
and don’t run any foolish risks.”
</p>
<p>I promised.
</p>
<p>“I hope you haven’t any guns on board.”
</p>
<p>“None that I know of.”
</p>
<p>“I’m afraid of guns.” She slipped something into my hand. “It’s a ten-dollar bill,
Jerry. Keep it for an emergency.”
</p>
<p>“There aren’t going to be any emergencies,” I boasted.
</p>
<p>“I hope not. But it has been my experience that not infrequently the unexpected happens.
Drop me a card when you get to Ashton. And be sure and brush your teeth and don’t
go dirty.”
</p>
<p>It was our intention to start on our trip as soon <span class="pageNum" id="pb72">[<a href="#pb72">72</a>]</span>as the show was over. So our folks, having been advised of our plan, were there to
say good-by to us. There was a lot of waving back and forth as the <i>Sally Ann</i> got under way. Then we passed under the bridge and the others were lost to our sight.
</p>
<p>“Well,” said Scoop, dropping into a seat on a box, “we’re off.”
</p>
<p>“The only thing I regret,” grunted Peg, “is that we didn’t even scores with the Strickers
before leaving town. For we owe them something for that rope trick.”
</p>
<p>“Let’s send the ‘friendly ghost’ back to clean up on ’em,” grinned Scoop.
</p>
<p>“We’re fast leaving the ghost behind us,” I laughed.
</p>
<p>“I hope so,” Red spoke up quickly, squinting uneasily down the canal.
</p>
<p>Grinning, Scoop got to his feet and cupped his hands to his mouth.
</p>
<p>“Hey, mister friendly ghost,” he called, “give Bid Stricker a black eye for me.” He
sat down, still grinning. “It’s all right now,” he waggled. “We’re revenged.”
</p>
<p>In a short time we had left Tutter behind us. The moon was shining, making it easy
for us to keep the <i>Sally Ann</i> in the middle of the canal. <span class="pageNum" id="pb73">[<a href="#pb73">73</a>]</span>Peg was handling the tiller. Red had the engine in charge. Scoop and I had nothing
to do except to enjoy the ride and thrill in the thought of the probable adventures
that lay ahead of us.
</p>
<p>“Let’s have some refreshments,” Peg sang out.
</p>
<p>Feeling around under the deck, where our provisions were stored, Scoop brought out
a loaf of bread and the boiled ham that his father had generously donated. He made
two sandwiches apiece.
</p>
<p>Coming to the small wide waters, halfway between Tutter and Ashton, we anchored the
scow close to the right-hand wooded shore, putting out the required lights. Then we
turned in.
</p>
<p>Just before I dozed off I heard a fish flop close to the boat. It must have been a
big carp. Then a screech owl settled on a limb directly over the boat and told us,
in mournful, plaintive hoots, what it thought of us. There were thousands of fireflies
in the air. The night was wonderfully still. I filled my lungs with the cool air.
Wouldn’t it be fine, I thought, if I could always live like this, and never again
had to sleep in a bed in a stuffy bedroom?
</p>
<p>Peg was the first one up the following morning. We heard him give a yell, which was
followed by a loud splash.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb74">[<a href="#pb74">74</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Come on in, you sleepy-eyed bums,” he shrieked, splashing around in the water.
</p>
<p>“Next!” I shouted, skinning out of my underwear. Losing my balance, I bumped against
Red. We both went rolling.
</p>
<p>“Let’s get Scoop,” he whispered. So, in this scheme, we kept rolling until we bumped
against the leader. Jumping up, we threw a blanket over the tricked one’s head. While
he was fighting the blanket, to free himself, we ran and jumped into the canal, giving
him the horselaugh.
</p>
<p>“I’ll get even with you fellows to-morrow morning,” he told us from the deck.
</p>
<p>“Jump in,” we cried. “If you don’t, we’ll come there and throw you in.”
</p>
<p>“I’m after the red-headed engineer,” the leader cried, and leaping, he struck the
water a few feet from where the chased one was frantically scrambling up the bank.
Red managed to get out of the canal before his pursuer could touch him, and racing
along the tow path he made a flying dive. Scoop was close behind him. Pretty soon
the two of them came to the surface, sputtering and splashing.
</p>
<p>“Here he is, fellows,” Scoop panted, hanging to the prisoner by the hair. “I’ve captured
the engineer.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb75">[<a href="#pb75">75</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Make him dress and cook breakfast,” laughed Peg.
</p>
<p>It was a dandy warm summer’s morning. We had slept later than we had intended. But
we figured that there was still plenty of time for us to get to Ashton before noon.
</p>
<p>“We probably won’t be able to get an ad in to-night’s paper,” said Scoop. “But we
can have some handbills printed, telling about the show. Three-four hundred won’t
cost much. We can distribute them this afternoon, a light job. For Ashton’s a small
town.”
</p>
<p>Breakfast over, Scoop and I and Peg gave the dishes a hurried bath in the canal while
Red greased the engine, getting it ready for the day’s pull.
</p>
<p>But when we came to crank the engine it wouldn’t respond. Ready to give up, after
twenty minutes of steady winding, we finally got a faint explosion, then another and
another. Once in motion the motor quickly gained speed. But, oh, boy, how it smoked!
</p>
<p>Just before we came within sight of Ashton, two men appeared in the tow path, at a
lonely spot in the canal, signaling to us to stop and put them on the opposite shore.
</p>
<p>Red promptly stopped the propeller. As soon <span class="pageNum" id="pb76">[<a href="#pb76">76</a>]</span>as the scow brushed the bank the men jumped aboard. The leader was white-haired, a
man of probably sixty years of age, with a thin hard face and peculiar beady black
eyes. As I looked at him I was instinctively turned against him. He was the direct
opposite to the kind of a man that I liked. His face held hidden stories; even his
guarded movements suggested hidden unworthy things.
</p>
<p>The most noticeable thing about the other man, outside of his thin tallness and his
preacher-like coat, which came to his knees, was his nose. It was a big nose. And
what tended to make it seem still bigger was a wart on the end of it. I had to smile
as I looked at him. He made me think of pictures I had seen of the schoolmaster in
the Sleepy Hollow story.
</p>
<p>“Well, well,” he said, stepping around sort of jaunty-like and taking in everything
with a lit-up face. “What have we here? A stage! Upon my word, a genuine stage. And
seats! Ah-ha! I have, I believe, penetrated the secret. I am aboard a theatrical craft.
A theatrical craft, I should add, in charge of four young showmen. A juvenile venture
into the realms of the dramatic art. How interesting. How very, very interesting.
In this familiar atmosphere of the—aw—<span class="pageNum" id="pb77">[<a href="#pb77">77</a>]</span>spoken play, I am stirred to memories of past golden days.” He got on the stage and
sort of posed like an actor. I guess he would have given us an exhibition of his acting
if his blazing-eyed companion hadn’t turned on him in a sudden fury.
</p>
<p>“You fool!” the beady-eyed one cried. And at the cutting words, which were a sort
of indirect command, the actor stopped stone-like, a look of fear rushing into his
face.
</p>
<p>They were a peculiar pair. And when they left the boat I followed them with curious
eyes. There was a small dock here, to which two green rowboats were tied. Back from
the canal was a big house, built after the plan of an old-time log cabin, with a wide
summer porch in front and big fireplace chimneys.
</p>
<p>“Huh!” grunted Scoop, as the two queer men disappeared up the path that led to the
house. “They might at least have thanked us.”
</p>
<p>Red was excited.
</p>
<p>“Did you notice what the gabby one had in his coat pockets?”
</p>
<p>“What?”
</p>
<p>“Tools. Screw drivers and wrenches. I noticed that the pockets bulged. And when the
man came near me I took a good squint.… What <span class="pageNum" id="pb78">[<a href="#pb78">78</a>]</span>do you bet,” freckles made the guess, “that he isn’t a safe breaker?”
</p>
<p>“The one with the beady eyes,” Peg spoke up, “looked to me like the type of fellow
who would knife his best friend in the back for a bottle of horse-raddish.”
</p>
<p>“He’s got the other one scared of him,” I put in.
</p>
<p>Scoop was studying the lonely surroundings.
</p>
<p>“Do you suppose,” he inquired of us, in a sort of reflective way, “that the log house
is a counterfeiters’ den? That would explain the tools in the man’s pockets. And this
is the kind of a secluded place that counterfeiters would like.”
</p>
<p>“Lookit!” I pointed. “Here comes a girl around the corner of the house. She’s heading
this way. Let’s pump her.”
</p>
<p>Scoop saw a chance to have some fun.
</p>
<p>“We’ll let Red talk to her. For he’s the best lady-killer in the gang.”
</p>
<p>His engine having stopped for some reason or other, the engineer had gone to work
on it.
</p>
<p>“What’s that?” he inquired, lifting a greasy face.
</p>
<p>“Wipe off your chin and pull down your vest,” grinned Scoop. “For we’re going to have
company.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb79">[<a href="#pb79">79</a>]</span></p>
<p>Red let out his neck at the approaching girl.
</p>
<p>“Aw!… You think you’re smart,” he scowled.
</p>
<p>The girl came to the dock and regarded us with amused eyes. She wasn’t quite as old
as we were, probably not more than twelve. She wore a blue tam, which, as you may
know, is a sort of cloth hat with a tassel on top. Her dress was blue, too, the color
of her eyes.
</p>
<p>In his interest in the engine, Red had forgotten all about the approaching girl.
</p>
<p>“Blame it!” he cried, straightening and giving the balky engine a kick. “I can’t get
it started, fellows.” When he saw who was watching him from the dock, only a few feet
away, his face got two shades redder than his hair.
</p>
<p>“Maybe you’re giving it too much gas,” the girl spoke up. “We have an engine like
that in my grandfather’s automobile; and we’re always having trouble with it. Let
me show you what to do.”
</p>
<p>She jumped aboard and joined the worker. This tickled Scoop. And he got behind the
flushed engineer, nudging the latter in the ribs.
</p>
<p>“Huh!” Red grunted, scowling at the newcomer. “What do <i>you</i> know about machinery?”
</p>
<p>The girl looked at him and laughed.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb80">[<a href="#pb80">80</a>]</span></p>
<p>“What will you give me,” she asked, “if I start your engine for you?”
</p>
<p>“Huh!” Red grunted again, giving her a sort of contemptuous up-and-down look. This
thing of a small girl telling him how to run his own engine was more than he could
stand.
</p>
<p>The newcomer turned to Scoop.
</p>
<p>“Is ‘Huh!’ the only English word he knows?” she smiled.
</p>
<p>“At mealtime,” the leader laughed, “he can say ‘pie’ and ‘cake.’ And he can say ‘Pretty
Polly’ when he wants a cracker.”
</p>
<p>“Shut up!” scowled Red.
</p>
<p>Here the girl forgot about the engine in a sudden interest in our show stuff.
</p>
<p>“You have a regular theater, haven’t you? What kind of a show is it?”
</p>
<p>“Magic.”
</p>
<p>“Who is the magician?”
</p>
<p>“Me. This fellow,” the boaster further informed, pulling me forward, “is the ‘Living
Head.’ Ham-and-gravy over there,” he added, pointing to Peg, “is my chief stage assistant.
Little fuss-budget here sells tickets and takes in the mon.”
</p>
<p>“I’ll ‘fuss-budget’ you with a monkey wrench,” screamed Red, “if you don’t dry up.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb81">[<a href="#pb81">81</a>]</span></p>
<p>The girl pretended fright.
</p>
<p>“Does he eat people alive?” she inquired of Scoop.
</p>
<p>“Not as a general rule,” the leader returned seriously. “As a matter of fact, after
you once get acquainted with him, if you can stand his freckles and red hair, he’s
a pretty likeable sort of a kid.… Do you live here?”
</p>
<p>The girl nodded, with a quick glance toward the house.
</p>
<p>“It is my grandfather’s home,” she informed.
</p>
<p>“Does your father live here, too?”
</p>
<p>“No. My parents are both dead.”
</p>
<p>“Maybe,” said Scoop, “it was your white-haired grandfather that we just helped across
the canal.”
</p>
<p>“It couldn’t have been him. For he has been working in his flower garden all morning.
I just left him there.”
</p>
<p>“We put two men across the canal,” Scoop informed, “and they went into your house.”
</p>
<p>The girl looked at him, puzzled.
</p>
<p>“Two men?” she repeated.
</p>
<p>“Yes,” Red spoke up, giving the girl a spiteful look, “and they were a couple of bums.”
</p>
<p>The granddaughter’s eyes flashed angrily.
</p>
<p>“My grandfather doesn’t associate with bums.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb82">[<a href="#pb82">82</a>]</span></p>
<p>Red gave a tantalizing laugh, glad of the chance to anger the other.
</p>
<p>“<i>You</i> look like a bum yourself,” the girl cried, in a burst of passion. “And so do <i>you</i> and <i>you</i> and <i>you</i>,” she jabbed with her finger. “I hope you never get your old engine started. <i>There!</i>” and stomping her foot she turned and ran up the path to the house.

<h2 class="main">UNDER ARREST</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was a few minutes short of twelve o’clock when we drew up at the Ashton dock. Red
wanted to turn the organ on immediately, to sort of hilariously announce our arrival
in town. But Scoop shook his head on the freckled one’s suggestion. The better plan,
the leader said, would be to call on the mayor, first of all, and learn what the town’s
attitude was toward traveling shows.
</p>
<p>Several kids came running in the time that we were securing the <i>Sally Ann</i> to the dock.
</p>
<p>“Look at the funny boat!” one of the newcomers yipped.
</p>
<p>“It’s a show boat,” another cried, taking in our stage and seats with a pair of busy
eyes.
</p>
<p>“The greatest show of its kind an earth,” Scoop told the curious ones. “Kermann, the
master magician of the age. Makes tables appear and disappear right before your very
eyes. Carries a human head on a platter. Don’t miss it, <span class="pageNum" id="pb84">[<a href="#pb84">84</a>]</span>fellows. It’s a humdinger of a show. Cheap, too: only ten cents for kids.”
</p>
<p>It was good business for us, the leader said, to treat the kids right and answer their
questions about the show.
</p>
<p>“For they’ll go home,” he explained, “and tell their folks everything we’ve said.
Then, of course, the whole family will want to see what the show’s like.”
</p>
<p>When the <i>Sally Ann</i> was securely tied to the dock, Scoop and I started down the main street in search
of the mayor. His office, we were told upon inquiry, was in the town hall.
</p>
<p>A short, fat man with a friendly face, we took a liking to the executive as soon as
we set eyes on him. There was something about him that gave us confidence in him.
</p>
<p>“Well, boys,” he smiled, “what can I do for you this morning?”
</p>
<p>Scoop, as spokesman, explained about our show.
</p>
<p>“Um.… You say it’s a boys’ show?”
</p>
<p>“There’s four of us in it.”
</p>
<p>“Four boys?”
</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”
</p>
<p>“There aren’t any grown people back of the proposition, or in any way connected with
it?”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb85">[<a href="#pb85">85</a>]</span></p>
<p>“No, sir.”
</p>
<p>The mayor laughed in a sudden thought.
</p>
<p>“You must be the ‘enterprising young showmen’ that I read about in the Tutter newspaper.”
</p>
<p>“That’s us,” grinned Scoop.
</p>
<p>“Did Stair send you over here to ‘toot your show horn at our canal door,’ as he put
it in his newspaper article?”
</p>
<p>“Mr. Stair has nothing to do with our show,” Scoop assured quickly.
</p>
<p>There was a moment’s silence.
</p>
<p>“Well, we usually charge a license fee for traveling shows, but I guess we’ll forget
about the fee in this case. Yes, boys, you have my permission to go ahead with your
show. Only don’t try any skin-game. If you do, you’ll get into trouble.”
</p>
<p>We thanked him warmly, assuring him that our show was clean, and no skin-game, as
he called it.
</p>
<p>“Let me give you some free tickets,” Scoop offered.
</p>
<p>But the executive firmly brushed the tickets aside.
</p>
<p>“No, boys. I don’t accept presents for granting favors. To not do that is one of the
rules of my office. I thank you, though. And it isn’t <span class="pageNum" id="pb86">[<a href="#pb86">86</a>]</span>improbable that I will be around this evening to see what kind of magicians you are.”
</p>
<p>When we were almost to the door, Scoop turned back.
</p>
<p>“I wonder,” he said, “if you can tell us the name of the people who live in the log
house on the canal bank coming into town.”
</p>
<p>“You must mean the Garber place.”
</p>
<p>“There’s a girl about my size in the family.”
</p>
<p>“Yes; that is old Mr. Garber’s granddaughter. What about it?”
</p>
<p>“We saw a pair of suspicious-acting strangers hanging around there.”
</p>
<p>“Well?”
</p>
<p>“Maybe the place is a counterfeiters’ den.”
</p>
<p>The mayor gave a hearty laugh.
</p>
<p>“I don’t know who your ‘suspicious-acting strangers’ were; but I can assure you that
Mr. Garber himself is a most trustworthy citizen.”
</p>
<p>“The men went into the house,” Scoop hung on.
</p>
<p>“They may have been tramps begging a meal.”
</p>
<p>“Tramps,” was the quick reply, “don’t go to people’s front doors.”
</p>
<p>I could see from the mayor’s actions that he was impatient to get rid of us.
</p>
<p>“I hope,” he laughed, taking up a legal-looking <span class="pageNum" id="pb87">[<a href="#pb87">87</a>]</span>paper and giving it his attention, “that you boys prove to be better showmen than
you have detectives. Good day.”
</p>
<p>We quickly located the newspaper office. Entering the building, we found an elderly
man back of the counter writing in a big book. We tried to get his attention, but
he was too busy to notice us. Scoop got huffy.
</p>
<p>“Is this a printing plant?” he inquired in a sharp voice.
</p>
<p>The bookkeeper lifted his head and scowled at us over his glasses.
</p>
<p>“I <i>thought</i> it was a printing plant when I first came in,” Scoop went on, squinting around curious-like,
“but it seems to be a sort of waiting room … for customers.”
</p>
<p>The man’s face went red under the thrust.
</p>
<p>“What do you want?” he snapped.
</p>
<p>“Could you print four hundred handbills in a hurry?”
</p>
<p>“That all depends. Who’s orderin’ ’em?”
</p>
<p>“We are.”
</p>
<p>“And who are ‘we’?”
</p>
<p>Scoop chestily informed the other that we were in town with our floating theater and
proposed to give an evening performance.
</p>
<p>“To advertise our show,” he went on, “we’ll <span class="pageNum" id="pb88">[<a href="#pb88">88</a>]</span>need some printed handbills—small ones, about four inches by six inches. How soon
can you print them?”
</p>
<p>“Printin’,” the man said pointedly, “costs money.”
</p>
<p>“How much money?”
</p>
<p>“Um.… Four hundred four-by-six handbills will cost you three dollars.”
</p>
<p>At the leader’s directions I brought out my roll of greenbacks and peeled off three
one-dollar bills.
</p>
<p>“Well, well,” said the man, sort of thawing out at sight of our wealth.
</p>
<p>“If we give you the job,” Scoop said, “you’ve got to promise to have the handbills
ready for us by three o’clock. For it’ll take us a couple of hours to distribute them,
and we’ll want to complete the job before supper.”
</p>
<p>“Got much copy?”
</p>
<p>“Not more than a hundred and fifty words.”
</p>
<p>“That bein’ the case, I ought to git the job out by two-thirty easy.”
</p>
<p>Here is the advertisement that Scoop wrote:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first center"><i>SEE KERMANN, THE MASTER MAGICIAN</i>
</p>
<p>The Great Kermann is in town!—the master magician of the age.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb89">[<a href="#pb89">89</a>]</span></p>
<p>See him! See him! See him!
</p>
<p>He makes tables disappear right before your very eyes.
</p>
<p>The “Living Head,” the most baffling trick of modern magic—Kermann does it; actually
carries the “Living Head” about the stage on a platter.
</p>
<p>You will shiver; you will be mystified; you will laugh at the droll antics of the
amazing “Living Head.”
</p>
<p>A show for old and young.
</p>
<p>We will give our first performance in Ashton to-night, on our magnificent floating
theater, the <i>Sally Ann</i>, which will leave the central dock for a moonlight excursion down the canal at 8:30.
</p>
<p>Enjoy the moonlight ride; hear the orchestrelle.

</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>We stopped at a bakery and bought a pie and two loaves of bread, after which we hurried
to <span class="pageNum" id="pb90">[<a href="#pb90">90</a>]</span>the dock, hoping that dinner would be ready for us when we got there.
</p>
<p>Peg came running to meet us.
</p>
<p>“Did you see ’em?” he inquired, excited.
</p>
<p>“See who?”
</p>
<p>“The Strickers.”
</p>
<p>“What?” cried Scoop, staring.
</p>
<p>“They’re in town,” Peg waggled. “We saw them on the canal bridge about ten minutes
ago. Bid and Jimmy and the Watson kid. They were with a strange man.”
</p>
<p>A cloud came into the leader’s face.
</p>
<p>“If they try any of their tricks to-night,” he waggled, his jaw squared, “something
is going to drop.”
</p>
<p>When dinner was over we put everything in order on the boat, so that there would be
no hitch when it came time to give our evening show. Red had oiled the organ that
forenoon, so shortly after two o’clock we put the music-maker into snappy operation.
This drew the kids.
</p>
<p>“I’m putting a line or two in to-night’s issue about your show,” the newspaper man
told us, when we called at his office for our handbills. “I hope you have a good crowd.”
He listened sharply for a second or two, “Is that your orchestrelle that I hear?”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb91">[<a href="#pb91">91</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Sure thing,” grinned Scoop. “Isn’t it a darb?”
</p>
<p>“Is it playing a tune?”
</p>
<p>“ ‘The Old Oaken Bucket.’ ”
</p>
<p>The man grunted.
</p>
<p>“If that’s ‘The Old Oaken Bucket’ I’m ‘The Last Rose of Summer.’ Well, good luck,
boys. And thanks for the three dollars and for coming over and waking us up.”
</p>
<p>When we were in the street Scoop gave me half of the handbills.
</p>
<p>“You take the east side of town,” he instructed, “and I’ll take the west side. Leave
a handbill at each house; and where you see a woman on her porch, or standing in her
doorway, take off your cap and be very polite, so that she will have a good opinion
of us. If she asks you any questions about our show, give her a nice little spiel.”
</p>
<p>I had been at work for possibly thirty minutes when suddenly I heard my name called.
Turning quickly, and looking into the street, I saw Scoop in the back seat of an automobile.
A uniformed policeman was seated beside him. Jimmy Stricker and the Watson kid shared
the front seat with the driver. Bid was hanging to the car’s side, riding on the running-board.
</p>
<p>“You’re goin’ to catch it!” he yipped at me, screwing up his face in a mean way.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb92">[<a href="#pb92">92</a>]</span></p>
<p>My heart sank. For I realized that my chum was under arrest. And, plainly, it was
the policeman’s intention to arrest me, too.
</p>
<p>For an instant I thought of taking to my heels and running away. But I didn’t do that.
I had done nothing to justify arrest. So why should I play the coward and run away,
to be reminded of it ever afterwards by the hated Strickers? Besides, it wasn’t right
to desert my chum.
</p>
<p>Jumping out of the car, the policeman clapped a heavy hand on my shoulder.
</p>
<p>“You’re under arrest, young feller,” he growled.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb93">[<a href="#pb93">93</a>]</span></p>

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER X</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE GREASED PIG</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I was put into the car with Scoop, the policeman taking a seat between us, after which
the driver turned the car around and started back down the street.
</p>
<p>I was scared. I can’t deny it. However undeserving I was of arrest, the fact remained
that I had been picked up by the law. And innocent though I was, it might not be easy
for me to prove my innocence and thereby gain my freedom.
</p>
<p>The automobile stopped in front of the mayor’s office and the policeman gruffly ordered
us to pile out.
</p>
<p>“If you try to run away,” he scowled, “I’ll catch you an’ give you ten years at hard
labor.”
</p>
<p>That, of course, was a bluff, and I knew it. For I was well enough acquainted with
the processes of the law to know that it was a policeman’s job to capture law breakers
and not to sentence them.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb94">[<a href="#pb94">94</a>]</span></p>
<p>Still, I didn’t like to have him talk that way. It gave me a sort of trapped, helpless
feeling.
</p>
<p>We all went into the mayor’s office, the policeman and my chum and I in one group
and the car’s other four occupants in another group.
</p>
<p>The Strickers were in their glory. Walking on my heels, sort of, Bid kept saying under
his breath: “How do you like it, Jerry? Whose turn is it now? You will scare us with
your old ghost trick, hey?”
</p>
<p>I didn’t say anything back. For what was the use? However, I did a lot of thinking.
And, in mentally comparing myself with my tormentor, I told myself that I would rather
be a jailbird all the rest of my life than to have his mean disposition. Much as I
dislike the Zulutown gang, of which Bid is the leader (and I have good occasion to
dislike them, let me tell you), I don’t go out of my way to pester them. Nor do any
of my chums, for that matter. But when <i>we</i> do something that gains for us added fun or special public attention, it seems to
gall Bid and his gang to the point where all they care to think about is how they
can torment us.
</p>
<p>The mayor wasn’t behind his desk, so the policeman told the driver, a lanky, hungry-looking
fellow, to go out and find him.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb95">[<a href="#pb95">95</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Put your handbills over there,” the officer told us, pointing to a table beside the
room’s big desk. His scowl deepened as we obeyed him. “It’s plain,” he added, “that
you kids don’t know much about the ordinances of this here town.”
</p>
<p>I was less frightened now. For I had come to realize all in an instant how easily
I could get in touch with Dad if necessary. He would come in a hurry if I telephoned
to him that I was in trouble. And he’d know just what to do to gain my release.
</p>
<p>“What’s the idea of arresting us?” Scoop spoke up. “We haven’t done anything wrong.”
</p>
<p>“Is that so?” Bid put in, letting out his neck<span class="corr" id="xd31e2021" title="Source: ,">.</span> “My Uncle Ike, I want to tell you, is the town bill poster—”
</p>
<p>“Shut up!” thundered the policeman. “I’ll do the talkin’.”
</p>
<p>Scoop and I exchanged glances.
</p>
<p>“Is it against the law,” my chum inquired, getting a clue to the cause of our arrest
from what Bid had blurted out, “to peddle bills in this town?”
</p>
<p>“You bet your boots it is,” Bid waggled. “For the council gave my Uncle Ike the right——”
</p>
<p>“<i>Shut up!</i>” bellowed the policeman a second time. “If I have to tell you ag’in,” he threatened,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb96">[<a href="#pb96">96</a>]</span>acting as though he was talking across the continent to some one in New York City,
“I’ll throw you out.” He turned to us. “We don’t ’low every Tom, Dick an’ Harry to
throw bills ’round our town to litter up our streets. Not by a jugful! We’ve got a
town bill poster an’ it’s his job to ’tend to distributin’ handbills an’ puttin’ up
posters. That was him I just sent after the mayor.”
</p>
<p>Well, it was a relief to us to know that we weren’t charged with anything more unlawful
than peddling handbills without a permit.
</p>
<p>“Gee!” grinned Scoop, shedding his depression. “We thought you had us spotted for
a pair of escaped bank robbers.”
</p>
<p>“Here comes the mayor,” the policeman growled. “He’ll ’tend to your young hides.”
</p>
<p>The summoned executive came briskly into the room, followed closely by the hungry-looker.
</p>
<p>“What’s the trouble, boys?” our friend inquired.
</p>
<p>“The trouble is,” spoke up the policeman in his long-distance voice, “that they’ve
bin peddlin’ bills without a permit. Ike here caught ’em at it an’ called on me to
make the arrest.”
</p>
<p>“They hain’t got no right to go peddlin’ handbills in this here teown,” Ike put in,
wagging and <span class="pageNum" id="pb97">[<a href="#pb97">97</a>]</span>working his mouth as though he wanted to spit and didn’t have a place. We learned
afterwards that he was an uncle of the Strickers’. “The council made me official bill
poster,” he added, with more wagging, “an’ if they’s any bills to be put out in this
here teown, I’m a-goin’ to do it, by heck!”
</p>
<p>The mayor gravely inquired if we had been handing out bills. In his admission, Scoop
pointed to the handbills on the table. The executive picked up one of the bills and
read it.
</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, boys, but Ike has a case against you. We have an ordinance that prohibits
the distribution of circulars such as this except through our authorized bill poster.
I’ll have to register a complaint against you for disturbing the peace and fine you.
The fine will be one dollar each and costs. I have the right to withdraw the costs,
and I’m going to do that.”
</p>
<p>I had told Scoop about my “emergency” ten-dollar bill. We had laughed about it at
the time, saying to each other that we would have no occasion to use it. Now, as I
fished the greenback out of my pocket, I gave my companion a sort of sheepish grin.
</p>
<p>I was given eight dollars in change.
</p>
<p>“Remember,” the executive enjoined, holding <span class="pageNum" id="pb98">[<a href="#pb98">98</a>]</span>my eyes, “you’re to do no more bill peddling. If you want the rest of your bills peddled,
you’ll have to make arrangements with Ike.”
</p>
<p>The hungry one put out his neck, an eager look in his eyes.
</p>
<p>“I’ll peddle ’em fur a dollar,” he offered, working his mouth.
</p>
<p>“No, you won’t,” Scoop snapped, scowling. “We wouldn’t give you a penny if we never
had a bill peddled.”
</p>
<p>“Haw! haw! haw!” hooted Bid Stricker, acting big in his triumph over us. “Listen to
him blow.”
</p>
<p>“You’re going to get your pay for this,” cried Scoop, shaking his fist at the enemy.
</p>
<p>“Tut! tut!” the mayor put in quickly. “I won’t allow you boys to quarrel in here.”
</p>
<p>“Can we go now?” Scoop inquired shortly.
</p>
<p>“Certainly.”
</p>
<p>“Hey!” screeched Ike, as we started for the door. “They’re takin’ the handbills with
’em.”
</p>
<p>The mayor gave the screecher a sort of disgusted look.
</p>
<p>“Why shouldn’t they? The handbills are theirs.”
</p>
<p>“Yes,” whined Ike, more hungry-looking than ever, “an’ they’ll go peddlin’ ’em out
on the sly.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb99">[<a href="#pb99">99</a>]</span></p>
<p>The mayor followed us to the door, his hands on our shoulders.
</p>
<p>“Forget about it, boys. As I say, I’m sorry that it happened; but, of course, as long
as we have this ordinance I must stand by it.”
</p>
<p>When we came to the dock we had to pick our way through a knot of kids. Red was yelling
through the megaphone, telling the curious ones what a wonderful show awaited them.
But the spieler quickly put away his megaphone at sight of our angry faces.
</p>
<p>“Tee! hee!” he snickered, when he had been told about our arrest. “I wish I could
have seen you in the coop. I bet you made a swell pair of jailbirds.”
</p>
<p>“Laugh all you want to,” growled Scoop, “but the Strickers are going to get their
pay for this. We didn’t do anything to them when they tried to destroy our stuff.
And we didn’t go after them when they stretched the rope across the canal. But this
time they’re going to catch it.”
</p>
<p>We kept the organ grinding away all of the afternoon. The kids enjoyed it. We kept
telling them that they would miss the treat of their lives if they passed up seeing
the Great Kermann.
</p>
<p>Stopping the organ at five-thirty to get supper, <span class="pageNum" id="pb100">[<a href="#pb100">100</a>]</span>we started it again at seven o’clock. Quite a crowd turned out by eight-thirty. When
we gave our show, every seat was taken. The mayor was there with three kids. The fellow
with the hungry face separated himself from fifteen cents and decorated one of the
seats. Red told us afterwards that the policeman tried to get in for nothing, but
was told to “go chase himself.”
</p>
<p>Scoop went through with his tricks without a hitch. Peg and I had a lot of fun helping
him. I didn’t spoil the “Living Head” trick by yelling, as I had done at our first
show in Tutter.
</p>
<p>Red sold sixteen fifteen-cent tickets and thirty-six ten-cent tickets, a matter of
six dollars.
</p>
<p>We were happy in our success; and in talking about it back and forth it was quickly
decided that we should go directly to Steam Corners, instead of camping on Oak Island.
If everything was well with our boat at the conclusion of our next show, we would
long-distance our folks, begging permission to go farther from home with our show,
into the territory beyond Steam Corners. It would be vastly more fun giving shows
and earning money than camping. And if we did want to camp for a few days, we could
stop at Oak Island on our triumphant return home.
</p>
<p>It was our plan to pull out as soon as the show <span class="pageNum" id="pb101">[<a href="#pb101">101</a>]</span>was over; but before leaving Ashton Scoop and Peg got their heads together and started
off into the darkness. They said they were going shopping, to buy some bread and butter.
But from their actions I knew that they had another purpose in mind in leaving the
boat.
</p>
<p>Were they intending to corner the enemy in some dark alley and pass out a few effective
black-eye punches? I went worried in the thought of it. Not that I was afraid of the
Strickers—far from it. It was the thought of being jailed again, for fighting, that
troubled me. We had the mayor’s friendship. And I didn’t want to lose that friendship
by appearing a second time before him as a law breaker.
</p>
<p>So it was a big relief to me when I caught the sound of my returning companions’ laughing
voices. There was another sound, too, that I couldn’t place. A sort of gurgling, grunting
sound.
</p>
<p>I almost fell over in my surprise when the avengers appeared dragging a half-grown
pig.
</p>
<p>“What the dickens?…” I cried, staring.
</p>
<p>“It’s a present for the Strickers and Uncle Ike,” grinned Scoop, panting from his
hard work of lugging the big pig.
</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” I cried.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb102">[<a href="#pb102">102</a>]</span></p>
<p>The newcomers looked at each other and laughed.
</p>
<p>“We’ve got a peachy scheme, Jerry. We found the pig snooping about in an alley and
we’re going to take it to the town hall, where our friend Ike and the policeman are
gambling with a deck of cards and a box of matches.”
</p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd31e2098" title="Not in source">“</span>Scoop and I happened to be passing the town hall,” Peg picked up the story, “when
a familiar laugh punctured our ears. Creeping to a window, we peeped in. And there
was dear old Ike and the copper gambling their heads off.”
</p>
<p>“He’ll be ‘dear old Ike,’ ” grinned Scoop, “when we get through with him.”
</p>
<p>“They’ve got the door locked,” Peg went on, “so that no one can come into the room
and surprise them at their game, for the policeman, of course, is supposed to be in
the street. The Strickers are there, too. That’s the best part of all.”
</p>
<p>“Oh, boy!” yipped Scoop, hugging his stomach in his crazy laughter, “won’t there be
a scramble, though, when we drop the pig in the window? It’ll be worth the two dollars
that we paid, Jerry.”
</p>
<p>Well, we got the boat ready for a hasty get-away, then we gave the pig a thick coat
of machine grease. Dumping the greased porker into <span class="pageNum" id="pb103">[<a href="#pb103">103</a>]</span>a bag, we followed Scoop down a couple of dark alleys to the building where the policeman
and the bill poster were gambling with matches. The alleys were dark and we had to
move slowly, feeling our way around big boxes and other obstructions. To keep the
pig from squealing, we had fastened an old shirt of Peg’s over its snout.
</p>
<p>When we came to the town hall Scoop pointed out the open window. We crept up and peeped
in. The policeman and Ike were seated on opposite sides of a small table. The air
was heavy with the stale smoke from a couple of hard-working corncob pipes.
</p>
<p>“I’ll open it,” said Ike, putting in a match.
</p>
<p>“I’ll stick,” said blue jacket, pushing in a match on his side of the table. He studied
his hand. “Gimme three cards.”
</p>
<p>“I’ll bet a couple,” said Ike, pushing some more matches into the center of the table.
</p>
<p>“I’ll see you,” said blue jacket, “an’ raise you one.”
</p>
<p>Scoop snickered.
</p>
<p>“Here’s where <i>we</i> raise one. Get hold of the bag, fellows. Atta-boy! When I say ‘three,’ drop the pig
into the window. I’ll loosen the gag so that he’ll be able to give them some nice
sweet music.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb104">[<a href="#pb104">104</a>]</span></p>
<p>“I wish we could drop the pig on top of Bid Stricker,” giggled Peg.
</p>
<p>“Maybe we can,” laughed Scoop. “For smarty’s sitting almost directly under the window.”
</p>
<p>Well, we hoisted the porker into the air, dumping it into the room at Scoop’s signal.
It gave an awful squeal as it landed on the floor. I guess the poker players were
almost scared out of their wits.
</p>
<p>“Holy cow!” roared blue jacket. “It’s a pig.”
</p>
<p>There was a sound of tumbling chairs and the scurry of feet.
</p>
<p>“Some one dumped it in the window,” yipped Bid Stricker.
</p>
<p>“He’s comin’ your way, Ike,” roared blue jacket. “Grab him.”
</p>
<p>There was a crash as another chair went down.
</p>
<p>“You durn ol’ fool!” thundered blue jacket. “Why didn’t you hang onto him?”
</p>
<p>“I tried to,” screeched Ike, “but he got away from me.”
</p>
<p>“I’ll git him.”
</p>
<p>There was another crash.
</p>
<p>“<i>Ouch!</i> Jumpin’ Jupiter! He’s greased.”
</p>

<p class="figureHead">WE DUMPED THE PORKER INTO THE ROOM AT SCOOP’S SIGNAL.</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“I’m plastered with it. Jest look at me!” There was a whine in the high-pitched voice.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb105">[<a href="#pb105">105</a>]</span>“It’s all your fault, Ham Bickel. I wouldn’t ‘a’ grabbed him if you hadn’t made me.”
</p>
<p>We took a guarded squint into the room. The chairs and table were upset. The matches
and cards were scattered every which way on the floor. Scared out of its wits, the
pig was dashing first in one direction, then in another. The policeman and the Strickers,
with smeared hands and faces, were trying to grab it. But the four-legged scooter,
with its coating of grease, had no trouble keeping its freedom.
</p>
<p>“We better beat it,” Scoop advised. So we streaked it down the alley to the dock.
In a jiffy we had the <i>Sally Ann</i> untied and the engine churning.
</p>
<p>How slowly we moved! Would the policeman hear us making our escape? Would he start
after us?
</p>
<p>My heart remained in my throat, sort of, until the lights of Ashton disappeared from
our sight.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE MYSTERY THAT CAME WITH THE NIGHT</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Into the night, in the direction of the Oak Island wide waters, four miles ahead,
the <i>Sally Ann</i> slowly and steadily made its way, the engine throbbing under its load, the rudder
squeaking on its rusted hinge pins as Peg moved the tiller first one way then another.
</p>
<p>It was our plan to put up for the night within a mile of the big wide waters. Then
in the morning, in continuing our passage to Steam Corners, we could conveniently
stop at the island and fill our water cask at the spring in the rocks on the island’s
north side. We really didn’t have a cask; what we had for a water container was a
pail, but Scoop spoke of it as a cask in shaping our plans. Ships, he told us, always
filled their “casks” with water—he never had read in a story of a ship filling its
“pail.”
</p>
<p>We liked to have him talk that way. For it lent an added touch of adventure to our
cruise. We could almost imagine, in our talk, that we <span class="pageNum" id="pb107">[<a href="#pb107">107</a>]</span>were hardened south sea buccaneers bending a course to strike a rendezvous, as they
tell about in pirate stories, where needed food and drink awaited us.
</p>
<p>Having covered at least three miles in our moonlight passage, we stopped the engine
and tied the <i>Sally Ann</i> to the stubbed bushes that grew along the water’s edge.
</p>
<p>It was now close to twelve o’clock. And as we got ready to turn in, removing our shoes
and outer clothing for sleeping comfort, we joked back and forth, telling each other
that the “friendly ghost” was probably pacing the tow path, impatient for us to settle
down for the night so that it could board our boat at the customary midnight hour.
</p>
<p>And the funny part is that in our crazy talk we actually got Red scared. When we lay
down on the stage, wrapped in our blankets, the frightened one sort of snuggled up
to me, hanging to my arm. I didn’t shove him away. As a matter of fact I kind of liked
his evident dependence in me. It gave me a sort of steady, capable feeling.
</p>
<p>There was some final scattered talk about the greased pig and the Strickers. Certainly,
we boasted, laughing, we had turned a neat trick. We had outclassed the Strickers
in our smartness. <span class="pageNum" id="pb108">[<a href="#pb108">108</a>]</span>They’d think twice hereafter before electing to pester us.
</p>
<p>“If I can find a pig post card in Steam Corners,” Scoop laughed, “I’m going to mail
it to Bid Stricker. For I don’t want him to be in any doubt as to who dropped the
greased porker on top of him.”
</p>
<p>I often think of that night. It seemed to me as I lay in the moonlight, lulled by
the gentle night sounds, that the exciting and hazardous things in life were a million
miles away. Yet I was to learn, within a very few hours, that perils, grim and deadly,
were fast swooping down upon us.
</p>
<p>As Scoop said afterwards in recalling our evening’s light-hearted fun, those were
the last really care-free hours that we enjoyed throughout the remainder of our cruise.
After that night things moved swiftly—and the things that happened to us were not
pleasant things, as you will learn.
</p>
<p>But, as I have pictured in my story in the preceding paragraphs, we went to sleep
with untroubled, contented minds. It was a great lark, we told ourselves. Days of
hilarious fun lay ahead of us. Even Christopher Columbus’ voyage across an uncharted
ocean was scarcely less thrilling than this voyage of ours into the canal’s hidden
haunts.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb109">[<a href="#pb109">109</a>]</span></p>
<p>I must have been asleep for an hour or two. I was having a dream about the engine.
I was trying to start it, and couldn’t. The other fellows weren’t in the dream. I
was alone.
</p>
<p>After a lot of back-breaking work I managed, to get the engine started. As I straightened
I could hear the singing put! put! put! of the exhaust. Bending to its task, the engine
quickly picked up speed. I could feel the <i>Sally Ann</i> quiver as the propeller blades bit into the water. Another such dream, so real and
so vivid, I never had had.
</p>
<p>Suddenly I sat up, rubbing my eyes. Was I awake? I pinched myself. No, I wasn’t dreaming.
My mind wasn’t sleeping. And what I had dreamt to a result had actually taken place—the
<i>Sally Ann</i> was under way, was moving slowly down the canal, its motor singing in full speed.
</p>
<p>I jumped up. The others were still asleep. So I knew it wasn’t one of my chums who
had started the engine.
</p>
<p>“Wake up,” I breathed in Scoop’s ear, trembling in my excitement.
</p>
<p>“What the dickens?…” he gasped, sitting up. He blinked his eyes. “We’re moving!”
</p>
<p>“Some one’s stealing our boat.”
</p>
<p>He leaped to his feet.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb110">[<a href="#pb110">110</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Where’s Red and Peg? They may be playing a joke on us.”
</p>
<p>I pointed to the two sleepers.
</p>
<p>“Get up,” Scoop shook them. “We’ve got a fight on our hands.”
</p>
<p>“Who—who started the engine?” Red mumbled sleepily.
</p>
<p>“That,” Scoop gritted, “is what we’re going to find out.”
</p>
<p>The freckled one, now wide awake, went into a frightened panic.
</p>
<p>“Oh!…” he gurgled. “Maybe it’s the—the ghost.”
</p>
<p>Scoop grunted.
</p>
<p>“The Strickers probably. Git a club, fellows. Here’s an extra one. Come on.”
</p>
<p>Peg was directly behind the courageous leader, I came next, then Red. He was hanging
to me and gurgling. In other adventures of ours I had seen him scared, but never anything
like this. I could feel the thumping of his heart in his grip on my arm. Maybe, though,
it was my own heart that I detected.
</p>
<p>We tiptoed single file across the scow’s pit. It was still moonlight, but the silver
light was of no aid to us in identifying the engineer who was running off with our
boat, for the motor and tiller <span class="pageNum" id="pb111">[<a href="#pb111">111</a>]</span>were hidden from our sight by a hanging canvas that we had put up to keep the engine’s
flying oil from spattering the clothing of our back-row customers.
</p>
<p>That a steady hand was holding the tiller we could not doubt. For the scow was keeping
its proper course. Yet, as we bent our ears we could detect no human sounds from behind
the screen—there were no whispering voices or the scraping of feet on the wooden deck.
</p>
<p>Gosh! I began to share Red’s panicky fear. For I suddenly realized that there was
something ghostly in our experience.
</p>
<p>As I say, in my stealthy approach on the curtained engine, I was directly behind Peg,
He was close on Scoop’s heels. So, when the leader slowly lifted the hanging canvas,
I had a clear view of the engine deck over my chums’ shoulders.
</p>
<p>There was a lantern beside the engine. I saw that it was a lantern that didn’t belong
to us. From the attracting spot of light I lifted my eyes to the helmsman. And then.…
</p>
<p>We went back in a heap, Red groaning at the bottom of the human pile.
</p>
<p>“Did—did you see who it was?” gasped Scoop, gaining his feet.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb112">[<a href="#pb112">112</a>]</span></p>
<p>“The girl in the blue tam,” I breathed, dizzy.
</p>
<p>Here was an amazing mystery. Our boat was being stolen by a girl. Beyond all doubt
she was acting to a purpose. But what that purpose was I could not conceive.
</p>
<p>Yet in my dizziness I had a crazy grinning thought. Here we were, four big boys, armed
with clubs, creeping up on one lone girl. Four boys, I might add, who were only half
dressed.
</p>
<p>“Go-osh!” shimmied Red, weak-kneed in his tumbling embarrassment, “where’s m-my p-pants?”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb113">[<a href="#pb113">113</a>]</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="ch12" class="div1 chapter"><span class="pageNum">[<a href="#xd31e417">Contents</a>]</span><div class="divHead">
<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE BURIED TREASURE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We made short work of getting into our clothes—all except Red. Having stepped out
of his pants without any recollection of where he had dropped them, he was having
a sweating time in their loss. His teeth chattering, a hunted look in his bulging
eyes, all he seemed able to say in his embarrassing predicament was: “Where’s m-my
p-pants? My g-gosh, fellows! Who’s got m-my p-pants?”
</p>
<p>We finally located the misplaced pants for him and shoved them at him.
</p>
<p>“Snap into it,” Peg said sharply. “We aren’t going to wait for you all night.”
</p>
<p>“It isn’t night,” Scoop corrected, squinting at his watch’s illuminated dial. “It’s
two o’clock in the morning.”
</p>
<p>We had taken note as we dressed that the scow was heading for the big wide waters.
And in this discovery our puzzlement deepened. There would have been some excuse for
the girl’s presence <span class="pageNum" id="pb114">[<a href="#pb114">114</a>]</span>on the boat if it had been traveling in the direction of her home. But it wasn’t.
Every minute the boat was taking her farther away from her home. We couldn’t understand
it.
</p>
<p>Was she trying to act smart with us? Was this a trick of hers to show us how much
she knew about engines? We were angered in the thought. But we quickly sobered in
the earnest conclusion that it was no skylarking whim that had brought her here.
</p>
<p>“I began to think,” she spoke up, when we had appeared on the engine deck, “that you
never were going to wake up.”
</p>
<p>“How did you get here?” Scoop inquired, staring.
</p>
<p>She pointed to a towed rowboat.
</p>
<p>“It’s one of my grandfather’s boats. I was supposed to row all of the way to the island.
He told me to. But I—I became frightened, and in my fright I lost my strength. It
was so lonely and spooky on the canal.… I could hear things splash in the water. Then,
when I was about to give up, unable to go farther, I came to your boat. Oh!… You can’t
imagine how glad I was. For I knew you would help me.”
</p>
<p>I saw how white she was.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb115">[<a href="#pb115">115</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Here,” I offered quickly, “let me take the tiller.”
</p>
<p>“What kind of help do you want?” Scoop inquired, when the girl had dropped into a
seat on a box.
</p>
<p>She didn’t make an immediate reply.
</p>
<p>“Do you know where Oak Island is?” she spoke finally, lifting her face.
</p>
<p>Scoop nodded.
</p>
<p>“I have been sent there, in the dark, to bury this,” and she pointed to a brass box
at her feet.
</p>
<p>We stretched our necks at the indicated box, visible in the lantern’s light.
</p>
<p>“What’s in it?” came Scoop’s natural inquiry.
</p>
<p>“Bonds.”
</p>
<p>“Liberty Bonds?”
</p>
<p>“Twenty of them,” the girl said quietly, “worth a thousand dollars apiece.”
</p>
<p>We stared at the speaker in sudden amazement. For we realized that twenty thousand
dollars was a fortune.
</p>
<p>“Grandfather and I have been to Oak Island a great many times. Once we camped there
a week. And when it became necessary to-night to hide the bonds, to keep them from
being stolen, the island was the only place he would consider.” <span class="pageNum" id="pb116">[<a href="#pb116">116</a>]</span>She took a long look into the darkness, in the direction of the left wooded shore.
Evidently she recognized her surroundings, for she added in confidence: “We’ll soon
be there. And I’m supposed to stay there, in hiding, until he comes for me.”
</p>
<p>Scoop found his voice.
</p>
<p>“Twenty thousand dollars!” he cried, staring at the box. He looked up quickly, his
eyes narrowed in sudden suspicion. “You aren’t stringing us?”
</p>
<p>The girl wearily shook her head.
</p>
<p>“I’ve told you the truth, even to the amount of the bonds.”
</p>
<p>Our leader gave her a queer look.
</p>
<p>“How do you know,” he said, “that we won’t take your bonds away from you and keep
them?”
</p>
<p>But she didn’t seem to hear him.
</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” she said, after a moment, “that I flew angry yesterday morning and said
cross things to you. I found out later that the white-haired man you mentioned was
my Uncle Feddon, my grandfather’s brother. It was generally supposed that he was dead.
From the time he was a small boy he has been a sort of tramp. The last time he was
home he forged Grandfather’s name to a check. There was an awful quarrel. <span class="pageNum" id="pb117">[<a href="#pb117">117</a>]</span>When he went away that night he stole money and papers from the library safe.”
</p>
<p>Scoop couldn’t pry his thoughts from the bonds.
</p>
<p>“Your grandfather must be a queer man to keep his money and bonds in the house. My
father has some Liberty Bonds, but he keeps them in a bank.”
</p>
<p>After a moment’s flushed hesitation, the girl burst out:
</p>
<p>“My grandfather <i>is</i> a queer man. He does things that can hardly be explained unless one concludes that
his—his mind isn’t quite—”
</p>
<p>“I understand,” Scoop cut in quickly.
</p>
<p>“But you mustn’t think he’s crazy,” the girl cried, in added distress. “For he isn’t—not
a bit of it. He’s just queer in a few ways. He should have kept the bonds in the bank.
And why they were taken out of the bank is more than I can tell you. In fact, I didn’t
know they were in the house until he came into my room a few hours ago, telling me
that he needed my help. He said he was afraid of my uncle and the other man, both
of whom were drinking and quarreling in the kitchen. Given the box of bonds, I was
told to take the box to Oak Island and bury it under the big tree on the knoll. ‘There
are twenty bonds in the box,’ Grandfather told me, trembling <span class="pageNum" id="pb118">[<a href="#pb118">118</a>]</span>with excitement, ‘worth a thousand dollars apiece. You must help me hide them where
your Uncle Feddon won’t ever be able to find them.’
</p>
<p>“I asked him why I couldn’t take the bonds to Ashton, getting the help of the police.
‘No, no!’ he cried, more excited than ever. ‘You mustn’t do that, child. I don’t want
the Ashton people to know that your uncle is here. They will arrest him. Do as I say.
Take the bonds to the island. Bury them. They will be safe from your uncle there.
And wait on the island until I come for you.’
</p>
<p>“I didn’t like to think of going away and leaving him in the house with the quarreling
men. So I ran to the garage, awakening the gardener, who sleeps there. Getting a lantern
from him, I asked him to go to the house and stay with my grandfather. He asked me
why I was up at such a late hour and what I was doing with the brass box. I didn’t
tell him. Running to the dock, I untied one of the rowboats and started out. I rowed
and rowed. I became frightened, as I say, and weak. Coming within sight of your boat,
I first thought I would awaken you. I would tell you my story, I decided, and get
you to take me to the island. Then I made up my mind to start the engine myself. I
wanted to prove to <span class="pageNum" id="pb119">[<a href="#pb119">119</a>]</span>you,” she concluded, looking at Red with the trace of a smile, “that a girl can be
<i>almost</i> as handy with machinery as a boy.”
</p>
<p>We were now in the big wide waters. There was a naked shore line to the right of us,
barely discernible in the darkness, but on the left there was nothing but an expanse
of water as far as our eyes could see. Here the channel was marked with parallel rows
of white piles set a hundred feet apart. To get to the island, on our left, it would
be necessary for us to make a right-angle turn, passing between the piles on the left-hand
side.
</p>
<p>This we did successfully by slowing the engine and using poles, carried on the boat
for that purpose. The water was shallow outside of the channel. And of no desire to
get hung up on a mud bar, we let the boat sort of crawl along in the darkness. The
island was ahead of us, a vague black shape, and when we were within two hundred feet
of the shore we stopped. Putting out our anchor, we rowed to shore in the girl’s boat.
</p>
<p>Landing, Peg went ahead with the lantern, leading the way, the rest of us following
single file. Taking a winding course amid bowlders and through thickets we came to
the island’s summit, <span class="pageNum" id="pb120">[<a href="#pb120">120</a>]</span>where the granddaughter had been instructed by her queer relative to bury the brass
box.
</p>
<p>At a spot selected by Scoop we dug a hole about two feet deep, into which the box
of bonds was dropped and covered up with loose dirt. There was an unusually large
bowlder a short distance away. Having dug our hole in line with the bowlder and the
island’s largest tree, Scoop now informed us that the spot where the treasure was
buried was exactly fourteen paces from the bowlder and nine paces from the tree. I
held the lantern while he drew a map of the treasure’s hiding place. The girl said
this was unnecessary. But, that didn’t stop him. It was customary in burying treasure,
he said, to make a map of the treasure’s hiding place. We wouldn’t be doing the job
right, he further declared, if we omitted the map. What he drew will be found on the
opposite page.
</p>
<p>It was now close to four o’clock. No one had any thought of going to sleep; so we
decided to bring our food on shore and have an early breakfast.
</p>
<p>Scoop and I rowed to the scow, talking and laughing. It was almost unbelievable, we
said, that we had just helped a girl bury a twenty-thousand-dollar <span class="pageNum" id="pb121">[<a href="#pb121">121</a>]</span>fortune in Liberty Bonds. We wondered if we wouldn’t wake up, after all, to learn
that our adventure was nothing more than a crazy dream.
</p>
<p></p>

</div><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb122">[<a href="#pb122">122</a>]</span></p>
<p>Coming within a few yards of the scow, we were startled by a sound of footsteps. Instantly
I thought of the ghost, and, reversing my strokes I quickly brought the boat to a
stop.
</p>
<p>“If it is the ghost,” Scoop whispered, squinting at the scow, a squat black patch
on the darkened water, “now’s our chance to find out who it is.”
</p>
<p>“I’m like Red,” I said, admitting to a lack of courage. “I almost wish I was home.”
</p>
<p>“Shucks! It’s a friendly ghost.”
</p>
<p>“It was yesterday,” I said, with a nervous shrug. “It may be an unfriendly ghost to-day.”
</p>
<p>He stood up and took a long look ahead.
</p>
<p>“Can you see anything, Jerry?”
</p>
<p>“Nothing but a black patch.”
</p>
<p>“I thought I saw something white.”
</p>
<p>“You probably did,” I shivered.
</p>
<p>“Row closer.”
</p>
<p>“Let’s wait until daylight.”
</p>
<p>But he wouldn’t listen to me. And reluctantly I dipped the oars in at his orders and
brought the rowboat against the scow’s side. In another moment he had scrambled on
board the big boat, disappearing from my sight.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb123">[<a href="#pb123">123</a>]</span></p>

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h2 class="main">AMAZING NEWS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Two—three minutes passed. I could hear Scoop tiptoeing about the boat. He would take
a few guarded steps, then pause. I could imagine that he was boring the darkness with
his probing eyes and listening for sounds of the ghost. I, too, listened to see if
I could hear the ghost. But no sounds came to my sharpened ears other than the stealthy
movements of my chum.
</p>
<p>The moon, in the time that we had made our way into the big wide waters, had vanished
behind a breastwork of clouds. In landing on the island we had worked in darkness,
except for the light of the flickering lantern. I realized now that my companion and
I should have brought the lantern with us to the scow. It would have given us an advantage
in enabling us to see what we were doing and what lay beyond our arm’s reach.
</p>
<p>I wondered, in a scattered, uneasy way, at the now total absence of the moon. There
was something ominous in the depth and silence of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb124">[<a href="#pb124">124</a>]</span>darkness that engulfed us. And on the moment, keyed up and nervous, I had the crazy
imaginative thought that the night was conspiring against us. It was on the ghost’s
side. The darkness was intended to shield the ghostly intruder from our sight, enabling
it to do its work unseen and unhampered.
</p>
<p>Its work! I repeated the words in my pondering mind. What was its work? What could
be its object in repeatedly coming to the scow? Was it indeed a man as we had thought?
Or was it, after all, a spirit from another world?
</p>
<p>“Jerry!”
</p>
<p>Carried along by my thoughts of ghosts and spirits, I gurgled, startled, as my chum’s
low sharp voice came out of the darkness a few feet away.
</p>
<p>“Let’s get out of this,” I shivered.
</p>
<p>“There’s no one here,” he declared, talking to me over the side of the scow.
</p>
<p>“We heard some one.”
</p>
<p>“Our ears must have tricked us.”
</p>
<p>I was still shivering.
</p>
<p>“Get in the boat,” I urged, “and we’ll row back to the island.”
</p>
<p>“Huh! And what are we going to tell Red and Peg when they ask us where the food is?”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb125">[<a href="#pb125">125</a>]</span></p>
<p>I saw what he meant. He didn’t want to go back to the island empty-handed, to be laughed
at by our companions. Nor did I, for that matter. It isn’t any fun to be called a
coward in front of a girl. So I sort of gritted my teeth in dogged courage and joined
the other on board the scow.
</p>
<p>“What’s that out there?” I pointed, breathless.
</p>
<p>“Where?”
</p>
<p>“Between here and the channel. Looks like a rowboat.”
</p>
<p>“I see what you mean.… It isn’t moving.”
</p>
<p>We strained our eyes at the vague black spot on the water’s surface.
</p>
<p>“Must be a floating log,” Scoop concluded.
</p>
<p>I didn’t believe that it was a log—I could think of nothing else but a passengerless
rowboat. But I didn’t argue the matter. I was too anxious to complete our errand on
board the scow so that we could get back to shore.
</p>
<p>Upon our arrival at the island with the food, the girl sort of took charge of things,
in the way women do at picnics. Building a roaring fire on the beach, we had toast
and cocoa and fried-cakes and bananas. It was a swell feed.
</p>
<p>Watching the others running here and there in the red light of the fire, one with
a piece of toast <span class="pageNum" id="pb126">[<a href="#pb126">126</a>]</span>and another with a fried-cake or a cup of cocoa, I was reminded of that part of the
Robinson Crusoe book where the cannibals brought Friday to the island to make soup
of him. They had built a fire, just as we had done, and had danced around the blaze
while their soup was cooking. Robinson Crusoe, in watching them, had been filled with
fear in their presence on the island. I wondered, in a whimsical turn of my thoughts,
if, like the dancing cannibals, we were being covertly watched by eyes invisible to
us in the darkness.
</p>
<p>The sun came up in the time that we were washing the breakfast dishes. We could now
see to have some fun. Borrowing the girl’s boat, Peg and Red went rowing. It was their
plan, they told us, to make a circle of the island, keeping close to shore. There
is always fun in doing that, for one can catch glimpses of interesting wild life at
the water’s edge, beautiful spotted snakes and big bullfrogs and sometimes a long-legged
heron or a mud hen.
</p>
<p>Left alone, Scoop and I and the girl set out to explore the island afoot. Low and
sandy in its western portion, a thicket of willows and scrub oaks, there was a sharp
rise to the east, rocky and wooded.
</p>
<p>A story is told about a strange hermit who <span class="pageNum" id="pb127">[<a href="#pb127">127</a>]</span>had lived and died on the island, and in the course of our excursion, having climbed
the rocky hill, jumping from one bowlder to another, we came to the cave where, if
the hermit story is true, the island’s queer early occupant had made his home.
</p>
<p>And to view the cave from the inside one could not doubt that it had been an early
habitation, for it was not a natural cave, like many of the caves in our section,
but had been chiseled out of the white sandstone with unending patience. I know something
about caves, and I could imagine, as I stood in this roomy chamber, that its builder
had worked many months to complete it to his satisfaction.
</p>
<p>After an hour or two of rambling through the island’s hidden spots, the girl suggested
that we go back to the shore. It wasn’t improbable, she explained, that her grandfather
would appear at any moment.
</p>
<p>Peg and Red returned from their trip around the island, hilarious in the capture of
an old gee-whacker of a snapping turtle. It was now bearing hard on nine o’clock,
I noticed that the leader was moving restlessly up and down the sandy shore, looking
at the anchored scow one moment and peering in the direction of the canal’s <span class="pageNum" id="pb128">[<a href="#pb128">128</a>]</span>channel the next. At his signal I followed him into the thicket. Crossing the island
to the north shore, we had a drink at the spring in the rocks, then seated ourselves
on the trunk of a fallen tree at the water’s edge.
</p>
<p>“It’s time for us to start,” he said, looking at me with a troubled face.
</p>
<p>I saw what was on his mind. He didn’t like the idea of pulling out at nine o’clock,
as we had planned to do, leaving the girl alone on the island.
</p>
<p>“We might take her with us,” I suggested, hating the thought of giving up our proposed
show.
</p>
<p>He shook his head.
</p>
<p>“I don’t believe she’d consent to that. I know <i>I</i> wouldn’t,” he waggled, “if <i>I</i> had been sent here on an errand such as hers. I’d feel that it was my duty, sort
of, to stay close to the buried bonds.”
</p>
<p>In our further talk it was made plain to us that we could do one of three things:
Stay on the island with the girl until the grandfather came; proceed to Steam Corners
at the time appointed, leaving her unattended on the island; or take her with us.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb129">[<a href="#pb129">129</a>]</span></p>
<p>When we put the matter up to her she laughingly told us that we were making a mountain
out of a molehill. Her grandfather, she declared, would soon put in an appearance.
And until he came she was perfectly safe on the island. With a slightly clouded forehead
and a determined set of her mouth she told us, in conclusion, that she would be both
annoyed and provoked if we changed our plans on her account. It wasn’t to be thought
of.
</p>
<p>“And you’re dead sure,” Scoop hung on, wanting to do the right thing, “that you won’t
be scared to stay here alone until your grandfather appears?”
</p>
<p>“Scared?” She gave a scornful laugh and sort of boastingly squared her shoulders.
“I should say not. What is there to be scared of? As I told you last night, I’ve been
here dozens of times. I know where the spring is, so I won’t have to go thirsty. And
if a shower comes up, I’ll run for the cave.”
</p>
<p>“You haven’t anything to eat,” our leader reminded.
</p>
<p>“Grandfather will bring something.”
</p>
<p>“He might not get here for several hours.”
</p>
<p>“Well,” the girl laughed, giving her curls a <span class="pageNum" id="pb130">[<a href="#pb130">130</a>]</span>saucy toss in the persistent one’s face, “if you’re really afraid that I’ll starve,
you can leave me a dill pickle and a toothpick.”
</p>
<p>“There’s a chunk of boiled ham on the scow,” Scoop told her. “We’ll get it and you
can make yourself some sandwiches.”
</p>
<p>But Red couldn’t put his hands on the ham when he was sent after it.
</p>
<p>“You fellows must have ate it,” he yipped to us across the water.
</p>
<p>“If any one ate it you did,” Scoop yipped back. “It was there last night.”
</p>
<p>The searcher disappeared for another moment or two.
</p>
<p>“You’re crazy,” he yipped. “There isn’t any sign of a ham here. I’ve looked everywhere.”
</p>
<p>“He’s the limit,” Scoop grumbled to us, showing his disgust of the other. “Honest
to Peter, he wouldn’t be able to find his nose if it wasn’t hinged to the front of
his freckled face. <i>I</i> could find the ham,” he boasted, “if <i>I</i> was there.”
</p>
<p>“Here’s a glass of dried beef,” Red yipped from the scow. “I’ll bring that.”
</p>
<p>Well, we left the girl a bottle of olives and some crackers in addition to the dried-beef
sandwiches that she made for herself. Then we went on board the scow in her rowboat.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb131">[<a href="#pb131">131</a>]</span></p>
<p>In saying good-by to us she told us that her name was Elizabeth Garber, and taking
down our names on the back of her buried-treasure map she promised that her grandfather
would write to us, thanking us for the help we had given her.
</p>
<p>“And when you get home,” she concluded, pink spots showing in her cheeks at the suggestion,
“you might write me a nice long letter telling me about your adventures and your wealth.”
</p>
<p>“Sure thing we will,” Scoop promised. “How do you want us to address the letter,”
he grinned, “ ‘Elizabeth’ or ‘Betty’ or just plain ‘Liz’?”
</p>
<p>The questioned one matched the questioner’s grin.
</p>
<p>“You can take your pick of the three names,” she laughed.
</p>
<p>“We’ll make it ‘Liz,’ ” Scoop laughed.
</p>
<p>It disgusted Red to think that we should thus talk to a girl. And to get rid of her
he started the engine. When we had reached the channel, having passed through the
piles, making a right-angle turn to the left, we could see her sitting in her green
rowboat waving her handkerchief.
</p>
<p>When we were well on our way the leader suddenly remembered about the misplaced ham
and gave himself the job of finding it. But in this he was no more successful than
Red had been. <span class="pageNum" id="pb132">[<a href="#pb132">132</a>]</span>As a consequence his face was sheepish when he returned to us empty handed.
</p>
<p>“Honest, fellows, don’t you know where the ham is?”
</p>
<p>Peg and I and Red shook our heads.
</p>
<p>“It was under the engine deck last night,” the defeated one told us. “But it isn’t
there now.”
</p>
<p>That a thief had been on board the boat we could not doubt. And in the thought the
leader gave me a queer look.
</p>
<p>“Evidently, Jerry, our ‘friendly ghost’ has sticky fingers.”
</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Peg inquired quickly.
</p>
<p>Scoop told the other two about the scare that he and I had had before daylight.
</p>
<p>“And you think it was the ghost who stole the ham?”
</p>
<p>“Who else could it have been?”
</p>
<p>A hungry ghost! There was humor in the thought. But our laughter was touched with
uneasiness. For the ghost’s repeated visits to the boat was fast putting an edge on
our nerves.
</p>
<p>Peg had held to the troubled thought that we might have some difficulty in steering
the <i>Sally Ann</i> through the Steam Corners lock. But we didn’t. It was as easy as pie. The lock tender,
a stoop-shouldered, talkative old man, saw us <span class="pageNum" id="pb133">[<a href="#pb133">133</a>]</span>coming and had the gate open. We ran into the lock under slow power and were quickly
raised to the canal’s higher level.
</p>
<p>Just before we got to Steam Corners Red discovered that he had used up the last of
the engine oil, so when we drew up at the town dock, close to the bridge, he went
in search of a garage.
</p>
<p>The rest of us busied ourselves preparing dinner. But before the meal was half ready
the freckled one came into sight on the run, with a look on his spotted face that
almost scared the wits out of us.
</p>
<p>He had his can of oil in one hand and a newspaper in the other. He had picked up the
newspaper in the garage where he bought the oil, he panted, pointing to a heading
on the front page.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first"><i>GRANDDAUGHTER COMES UP MISSING WITH VALUABLE BONDS</i>
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p><i>Aged Relative in Hospital With Head Wound</i></p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>Well, our hearts were in our throats, sort of, as we read the astonishing newspaper
article. Steven Garber, the article stated, a retired banker, had been mysteriously
assaulted in his summer home near Ashton, Illinois. The <span class="pageNum" id="pb134">[<a href="#pb134">134</a>]</span>gardener, summoned to the house in the middle of the night by the aged man’s granddaughter,
had found his employer in a pool of blood on the kitchen floor, near to death from
a vicious head wound. It was known that the attacked financier had been keeping a
large sum in Liberty Bonds in the house, and as the bonds had disappeared it was the
theory of the police that the valuable certificates had been stolen by the granddaughter,
Elizabeth Garber, who was being sought in the belief that she held the key to the
mystery of the attempted murder. It was the twelve-year-old granddaughter who had
awakened the gardener in his sleeping quarters in a detached garage, begging him to
go immediately to the house, where, so he was told, he was needed by his employer.
It was upon the gardener’s entrance into the house a few minutes later that the unconscious
form on the kitchen floor had been discovered. The granddaughter, carrying a brass
box in which it was believed that she had placed the missing Liberty Bonds, had escaped
in the night in a rowboat. The police were bending every effort to apprehend her.
In the meantime the assaulted grandparent was being cared for in the Ashton hospital.
The man’s head wound, the article concluded, was not essentially serious.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb135">[<a href="#pb135">135</a>]</span></p>
<p>Having read the article to its completion, we stared at one another in amazement.
We knew, of course, who had struck the blow that had sent the grandfather to the floor
unconscious. Without a doubt it was the rascally brother. Yet no mention of the brother
and his warty-nosed companion was given in the article. It would almost seem that
aside from us and the girl and the unconscious man in the hospital that no one knew
that the two men had been in the house.
</p>
<p>“What are we going to do?” Peg cried, bewildered.
</p>
<p>“I think we ought to go back to the island,” Scoop said, as dizzy looking as the other.
“The girl should be told of what has happened to her grandfather. Otherwise she may
wait at the island for him for several days. Besides, the bonds are in danger. She’ll
need our help to get them safely into a bank.”
</p>
<p>The danger to the bonds, the leader then explained, lay in the possibility of the
rascally uncle getting to the island ahead of us. No doubt the evil-minded one had
found out about the bonds before he had struck his brother down; he might even have
compelled the helpless brother to disclose the vanished granddaughter’s intended destination.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb136">[<a href="#pb136">136</a>]</span></p>
<p>Yes, it was to be a race to see who could get to the island first—and we thrilled
in the thought of the probable adventure that lay ahead of us. If we could get our
hands on the brass box, we were confident that we would be able to keep any one from
getting it away from us. Our great fear lay in the thought that we would get to the
island too late.
</p>
<p>In the time that we had been excitedly talking back and forth, a uniformed policeman
had come onto the canal bridge, stopping to give us a curious questioning eye. Of
course he didn’t know our secret, else he would have straightway arrested us. At least
that was our frightened thought. And fearful that we might be questioned, we quickly
loosened the boat’s tie rope and cranked the engine.
</p>
<p>Backing up until we came to a small wide waters on the edge of the town, we turned
the scow around, then headed for the island under an open throttle.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It had taken us the better part of two and one-half hours to make the run from Oak
Island to Steam Corners, a distance of possibly five miles. That was slow traveling,
to be sure. But, as I have said before, the <i>Sally Ann</i> was not a speed boat. Not unlike a clumsy old work horse, it could be made to go
just about so fast and not much faster. The thing it was least acquainted with was
speed.
</p>
<p>Still, we were hopeful that we would be able to shorten the time of our return trip
by at least thirty minutes, which would get us into anchorage off the island at two-fifteen
or thereabouts. And it was to accomplish this, if possible, that we were now running
the propeller full speed. This, of course, was hard on the engine. Worn in its many
joints from long usage, it was liable to break down at any moment. But our errand
was urgent. We had to take some chances.
</p>
<p>As Scoop stated at the time, we probably could <span class="pageNum" id="pb138">[<a href="#pb138">138</a>]</span>have made faster passage to the island in a rented rowboat. But we didn’t like the
thought of leaving our show boat behind. It would have required a guard, and that
would have demanded a division of our forces. We wanted to stick together; we felt
that we should stick together in the interests of our own safety. If it came to a
hand-to-hand fight, a not improbable turn of affairs, four of us could put up a better
battle than three of us.
</p>
<p>Shortly after one o’clock we came within sight of the lock that we had passed through
two hours earlier. The lock tender was waiting for us. I could imagine, as we approached
the lock under full speed, that the old man was surprised to see us back so soon.
For we had told him that morning that we were going to dock in Steam Corners to give
our show and stay there over night.
</p>
<p>“Um.… What you b’ys doin’ headin’ this way?” he inquired, regarding us in turn with
narrowed eyes.
</p>
<p>“Oh,” Scoop said airily, of no mind to take the other into our confidence, “we’re
just riding around for the fun of it.”
</p>
<p>“Goin’ back to Ashton?”
</p>
<p>“Maybe.”
</p>
<p>There was a moment’s silence, in which a look <span class="pageNum" id="pb139">[<a href="#pb139">139</a>]</span>of undisguised suspicion came into the narrowed eyes.
</p>
<p>“Um.… Calc’late you fellers better come up to my office an’ sign your names in my
book.”
</p>
<p>“ ‘Book’?” Scoop repeated, regarding the other quizzically.
</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s a cook book,” was Red’s smart remark.
</p>
<p>“No,” the old man waggled, setting his long shaggy hair into motion, “it hain’t no
cook book. It’s a ledger in which I keep a record of the people who pass through my
lock.”
</p>
<p>“You didn’t say anything about it this morning,” Scoop reminded.
</p>
<p>“Didn’t I? Wal, my memory hain’t always the best.”
</p>
<p>“If it isn’t necessary,” Scoop said, impatient to get through the lock, “we’d rather
not bother with it. For we’re in a hurry.”
</p>
<p>The narrowed eyes snapped.
</p>
<p>“In a hurry, hey? Thought you jest said you was a-ridin’ ’round fur the fun of it.”
</p>
<p>Our leader laughed.
</p>
<p>“Well, bring out your birthday book and we’ll autograph it.”
</p>
<p>“It’s in my office,” the old man waggled. “Jest come this way an’ I’ll show you whar
’tis. You <span class="pageNum" id="pb140">[<a href="#pb140">140</a>]</span>kin be a-signin’ it while I put your boat through the lock.”
</p>
<p>Well, we never suspected a trap. Unfamiliar with the duties of a lock tender it never
occurred to us that there was anything queer or irregular in the old man’s request
of our signatures in his book. At his direction we cheerfully followed him into the
house that he occupied on the canal bank and up a flight of stairs to a sort of attic
bedroom.
</p>
<p>“If you go over thar,” our stoop-shouldered conductor pointed, indicating a table
near the room’s only window, “you’ll find the book an’ a pen.”
</p>
<p>Peg was the first one to reach the table.
</p>
<p>“I can’t find a book with names in it,” he grumbled, feeling around among the table’s
contents.
</p>
<p>Scoop looked over his shoulder to make sure that our conductor had gone downstairs.
</p>
<p>“Maybe,” he laughed softly, tapping his head, “the old gent’s cuckoo.”
</p>
<p>Red wiped his sweaty face on his shirt sleeve.
</p>
<p>“Holy cow, it’s hot up here!”
</p>
<p>“There’s no book here,” Peg declared, with an impatient grunt.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb141">[<a href="#pb141">141</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Lookit!” pointed the freckled one, in a sudden unnerving discovery. “The door’s shut.”
</p>
<p>“What the dickens?…” cried Scoop, dashing across the room. “Hey!” he cried, shaking
the bolted door and pounding on its heavy panels with his fists. “What’s the idea
of locking us in?”
</p>
<p>“Quit your poundin’ on that door,” the lock tender roared from the foot of the stairs,
“or I’ll put a charge of bird shot through the floor into your feet.”
</p>
<p>“Let us out,” cried Scoop.
</p>
<p>“You’ll be let out, all right … when my brother Ham gits here with four pairs of handcuffs.”
</p>
<p>“You’ll lose your job for this,” screeched Scoop, furious. “For you have no right
to lock us up.”
</p>
<p>“I hain’t got no right, hey? Mebby you young scallawags don’t know who I be. Um …
I’m a deputy sheriff, let me tell you.”
</p>
<p>“Being a deputy sheriff,” cried Scoop, “doesn’t give you a right to lock up innocent
people. And you better let us out of here in a hurry, if you know what’s good for
you.”
</p>
<p>A bell jingled in the lower room as our captor wound up the crank of his country telephone.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb142">[<a href="#pb142">142</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Gimme Ashton two-six-six-four,” he ordered gruffly. “Hello. That you, Ham? Yep, it’s
me—Herm. Yep. Say, you know them young fellers that put the greased pig in your windy—yep,
the ones you called me up about at dinnertime. I told you they’d gone on to Steam
Corners. Wal, they just come back an’ I’m a-holdin’ ’em fur you. Yep, got ’em shet
in the attic bedroom. What’s that? You can’t come over till to-morrow? You’re lookin’
fur who? A gal? No, I hain’t seen nothin’ of a gal in a green rowboat. What’s that?
She tried to murder her grandfather? Pshaw! A twelve-year-old gal! Kin you imagine
it? Wal, if I see her I’ll hold ’er. Git over as early as you kin to-morrow. No, you
needn’t worry ’bout that. If they do try to escape I’ll fill their legs with bird
shot. I’ve give ’em fair warnin’ an’ they’ll have better sense ’an to try it. So long.”
</p>
<p>We hadn’t said a word in the time that our captor was telephoning. And it was well
for us, as we now realized, that we had given the one-sided conversation close attention.
For we had thus learned the cause of our arrest.
</p>
<p>“They’re after us for the greased-pig trick,” Scoop said, searching our eyes in turn.
“What do you know about that?” he whistled.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb143">[<a href="#pb143">143</a>]</span></p>
<p>“I thought it was for helping the girl,” Peg said, studying.
</p>
<p>“So did I.”
</p>
<p>There was a moment’s silence.
</p>
<p>“Dog-gone!” the leader burst out, with flushed cheeks. “Weren’t we the champion boobs,
though, to walk into that old hayseed’s trap? Got us up here to sign a book! Slick,
all right. But I thought we were too smart to get tripped up by a trick like that.
Gr-r-r-r-r!” and the angry speaker gritted his teeth. “It makes me furious to think
that we didn’t have sense enough to suspect the truth.”
</p>
<p>“We were asleep at the switch, all right,” Peg agreed, nodding dismally.
</p>
<p>Red set up a howl.
</p>
<p>“I wish I was home.”
</p>
<p>“Huh!”
</p>
<p>“I don’t want to go to jail.”
</p>
<p>“Who’s going to jail?”
</p>
<p>“We are. Didn’t you hear what he said about handcuffs?”
</p>
<p>“They can’t put us in jail for breaking up a poker game with a greased pig,” the leader
waggled, his jaw squared. “We may have to pay a fine, but that’s nothing to worry
about. A bigger concern in my mind is the girl.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb144">[<a href="#pb144">144</a>]</span></p>
<p>“<i>I</i> don’t believe,” Peg spoke up, thoughtful, “that they have a right to arrest us outside
of town for the pig trick. It looks to me like spite work on the policeman’s part.”
</p>
<p>Scoop passed quickly to the open window, to learn, I imagine, if there was any chance
of escape for us in that direction.
</p>
<p>“Lookit!” he pointed.
</p>
<p>Below us, comfortably seated in the shade of a tree, a shotgun in his lap, the lock
tender was contentedly munching a big rosy apple.
</p>
<p>“You b’ys comfortable up thar?” he drawled, getting sight of us in the window.
</p>
<p>“We could use a few palm-leaf fans to good advantage,” Scoop hinted, swabbing his
dripping face.
</p>
<p>“Calc’late it’ll git cooler toward evenin’.”
</p>
<p>“When do we eat?” Peg called down.
</p>
<p>“Hungry, hey?”
</p>
<p>“We haven’t had any dinner.”
</p>
<p>“Wal, it’s too late fur dinner now.”
</p>
<p>Scoop again gritted his teeth.
</p>
<p>“The old beast!”
</p>
<p>“Say,” Peg began to dicker, “what’ll you take to turn us loose?”
</p>
<p>“Um.… Tryin’ to bribe me, hey?”
</p>
<p>“We’ll give you five dollars.”
</p>

<span class="pageNum" id="pb145">[<a href="#pb145">145</a>]</span></p>
<p>“I hain’t a man with a price.”
</p>
<p>“How about ten dollars?”
</p>
<p>“Yep,” the old man waggled, munching his rosy apple, “it’s a powerful hot day.”
</p>
<p>“I didn’t say anything about the weather,” Peg growled, flushing. “I asked you if
you’d let us out of here for ten dollars.”
</p>
<p>“Yep, you’re right. We hain’t had a hotter day in ten years.”
</p>
<p>Scoop caught our big chum’s eyes.
</p>
<p>“You might as well save your breath,” he advised.
</p>
<p>“Anyway,” I sweltered, “he told the truth about the heat. This room is a regular oven.”
</p>
<p>Whenever I see a panting dog I am unhappily reminded by its dripping tongue and heavy
breathing of our confinement that afternoon in the lock tender’s attic bedroom. We
didn’t exactly hang out our tongues, dog-fashion, but we did strip off the most of
our clothes. The heat from the low sun-baked roof was almost unbearable. You could
have imagined from our dribbling perspiration that we had just been taking a sponge
bath and hadn’t dried off.
</p>
<p>Following our unsatisfactory conversation with our jailer, we explored our prison
in the hope that we would find some avenue to possible safe escape. <span class="pageNum" id="pb146">[<a href="#pb146">146</a>]</span>Besides the table and bed the room contained three chairs and a bureau. The plastered,
heat-soaked walls and hipped ceiling were decorated with fancy old-fashioned wallpaper,
against which, on opposite sides of the bed, were hung framed samplers. One read:
“Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.” The other
said: “I slept and dreamt that life was beauty; I woke to find that life was duty.”
</p>
<p>We met with nothing but discouragement in our exploration of the room. And abandoning
the hope of making an immediate escape, we dropped on the floor near the window. Tortured
by the heat, we were thirsty, too, and hungry. Here it was about two o’clock in the
afternoon and we had had nothing to eat since four o’clock in the morning.
</p>
<p>We had now given up all hope of getting to the island in time to help the girl save
her Liberty Bonds from the rascally uncle’s hands. Helpless in our sweltering prison,
we could picture in our tortured minds what was very probably taking place on the
island. The men’s arrival … the girl’s capture … the search for the bonds. The girl
would be compelled, under torture, if necessary, to reveal the treasure’s hiding place.
And with the bonds in their possession, the two <span class="pageNum" id="pb147">[<a href="#pb147">147</a>]</span>thieves could very easily put many miles between themselves and the island before
nightfall.
</p>
<p>Would the girl be left alone on the island? Or would the thieves take her away with
them? We wondered, depressed and discouraged.
</p>
<p>Suddenly we experienced new life at the sound of a lilting voice. Crowding in the
window, we had a clear view of the buoyant singer as he came jauntily into the yard.
</p>
<p>It was the man with the warty nose!
</p>
<p>We stared from the window, amazed and speechless. What was the thief doing here? Where
was his companion? Were the two men now making their escape into an adjoining county,
after having been to the island? Was the white-haired man waiting near by with the
recovered bonds? Was the girl with him?
</p>
<p>We were crazy in our helplessness. For here was a not improbable chance for us to
outwit the evil-minded pair and recover the stolen bonds. Fortune had favored us in
bringing the thieves here with their probable booty. But we were powerless to take
advantage of what fortune seemed to offer. As prisoners, we could do not a thing except
to look down from our jail window.
</p>
<p>Approaching the seated lock tender with jaunty <span class="pageNum" id="pb148">[<a href="#pb148">148</a>]</span>steps, the newcomer removed his shabby hat and made a sweeping bow, his left hand
pressed against his heart.
</p>
<p>“Good day, sir; good day. I observe that you are taking it cool and comfortable in
the shade, as a man in your favored circumstances should. It is very warm in the sun,
sir, and fatiguing to one afoot.”
</p>
<p>“Um.… Stranger, hain’t you?”
</p>
<p>“My name, sir, is Windbigler—Capricorn Hebrides Windbigler. You, sir, may have read
of the Windbiglers in the annals of science. My father, like my learned grandfather,
was a geographer of exceptional attainments. At my birth in the New Hebrides Islands,
in the South Pacific Ocean, I was given, under the dictation of our family’s distinguished
geographical specialist, the somewhat appropriate name of Capricorn Hebrides. A tribute,
my illustrious parent considered, to his beloved profession. Alas, sir, you see in
me nothing of the greatness of my learned and distinguished parent and grandparent.
I may even in my appearance seem a bit shabby to you. But, to apply an old axiom,
sir, not inappropriate to the occasion, it is not the clothes that make the piano
tuner. Here, sir, is my professional card. When you have perused it I will kindly
ask you <span class="pageNum" id="pb149">[<a href="#pb149">149</a>]</span>to return it, for it is the last one I have. Though it is somewhat soiled from daily
usage, I trust that its printed message will stand out before your eyes like a beacon
in the wilderness. Capricorn Hebrides Windbigler, the Harmony Hustler. Behold in me,
sir, the true friend and ardent supporter of our greatest American institution—the
parlor piano.”
</p>
<p>The lock tender, in the time of this long-winded recital, had been listening with
an open mouth.
</p>
<p>“Say,” he demanded, when the talkative one had paused for breath, “what in Sam Hill
be you spoutin’ ’bout, anyway?”
</p>
<p>“Sir,” gravely bowed the visitor, “I am, in simple, unflowered English, an itinerant
piano tuner. Some days I tune many pianos … for my meals. On the days when I have
no pianos to tune, I—er—acknowledge to the pangs of hunger. This, unhappily, is one
of the days when my artistic attainments have had no chance of commercial expression.
As the son of the late Ferdinand Windbigler—and I would have you know sir, that my
esteemed parent was named after the consort of the illustrious Queen Isabella—it pains
me, humiliates me, in fact, to be compelled, in my present reduced circumstances,
to confess to you that I am sadly in need of such <span class="pageNum" id="pb150">[<a href="#pb150">150</a>]</span>stimulating food as a baked potato and a crust of bread. And unless you have a piano,
sir, that I may tune, to recompense you for the hearty meal that I—aw—hope to get,
I dread to contemplate the early misery that my empty stomach will endure.”
</p>
<p>“Great balls of fire!” exploded the listener, blinking his eyes in bewilderment at
the flow of words. “Don’t you ever run down?”
</p>
<p>“Sir!”
</p>
<p>“By gum, you’re the windiest talker I ever heerd tell of. Windjammer’s a good name
fur you, all right. Windjammer! Hee! hee! hee!”
</p>
<p>“Windbigler, sir,” came the dignified correction.
</p>
<p>“It hain’t every tramp stoppin’ here fur a handout thet’s got sech a lingo as you
have. I never seed your beat.”
</p>
<p>“My dear sir … a tramp! … you quite distress and embarrass me. In the words of my
esteemed father, the late Ferdinand Wind——”
</p>
<p>“Shet up!”
</p>
<p>The Harmony Hustler bowed humbly.
</p>
<p>“I, sir, am ‘shet,’ as you so excellently put it.”
</p>
<p>“So you’re a pianny tuner, hey?”
</p>
<p>“A musical phonologist, sir, at your service.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb151">[<a href="#pb151">151</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Wal,” the lock tender spit, “I’ve got a pianny.”
</p>
<p>“I could imagine that to be the case, sir. For it has been my experience that where
there is music in the home, the countenances therein always have a nobler mien. And
as I approached you, sir, and gazed into your kindly countenance, I said to myself——”
</p>
<p>“Shet up, I tell you. Land of Goshen! <i>Sech</i> a talker! If I was compelled to live in the same house with you I’d wear ear pads,
by gum.”
</p>
<p>“I grieve, sir, if I have bored you.”
</p>
<p>“I’ve got a pianny, as I jest said. Bought it at a sale two years ago fur twenty-two
dollars an’ a quarter. A good pianny, too. One of them four-legged kind. Since my
wife’s death I hain’t had no use fur it. Bin tryin’ to sell it.” The speaker got to
his feet. “Come in,” he invited, holding the shotgun in the hollow of his left arm,
“an’ take a look at it. An’ if you kin fix it up so I kin sell it fur what I’ve got
in it, I’ll give you your supper an’ a night’s lodgin’.”
</p>
<p>We stared at one another as the two men disappeared from our sight. The warty-nosed
man’s conduct, like his presence here, filled us with bewilderment.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb152">[<a href="#pb152">152</a>]</span></p>
<p>There was a stovepipe hole in the floor of our prison. And as the two men came into
the room below us, we got around the hole in a circle, unmindful now of the heat in
our interest in what was going on below us.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h2 class="main">UNDER THE BED</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Scoop and Peg were bitterly angry over our arrest and imprisonment in the lock tender’s
attic bedroom. Red was scared. I was neither angry nor scared, but worried.
</p>
<p>What gave me that feeling was the unhappy thought that it wouldn’t please Mother and
Dad a little bit to learn, upon my return home, that I had been picked up twice in
daily succession by the law. To be arrested, even when one is innocent, is something
of a disgrace. Jails and prisons are things that any right-minded boy should keep
away from. I was sorry now that I had been led into the greased-pig trick. I realized,
when it was too late, that we had made a foolish blunder in trying to get funny with
the law.
</p>
<p>Upon the appearance of the talkative, warty-nosed man, my worries had taken a scattered,
anxious turn. I had the feeling that the evil-minded one had a hidden purpose in coming
here. I didn’t believe his crazy story about being born on <span class="pageNum" id="pb154">[<a href="#pb154">154</a>]</span>an island in the Pacific Ocean. And he wasn’t half as anxious to get the job of tuning
the lock tender’s piano as he let on. He was after something else. His exaggerated
piano-tuning talk was just a blind.
</p>
<p>Were <i>we</i> the “something else”? Did our presence in the house, as prisoners, have something
to do with the hidden purpose of his visit? This was not a comfortable thought to
me. Involved in the theft of the Liberty Bonds (we still held to the thought that
the evil pair had stolen the bonds from their hiding place on the island and that
the other thief was waiting near by with the booty) he plainly was a dangerous man.
More than that he was a <i>deep</i> man, as the saying is. His flowery put-on conversation with the lock tender coupled
with his acting had proved that. I had no desire to come under his power, either as
a friend or an enemy. I was afraid of him. I wished with all my heart that he was
a thousand miles away.
</p>
<p>As I wrote down in the concluding paragraph of the preceding chapter, there was a
stovepipe hole in the floor of our prison. And the entrance of the two men into the
house had found us on our stomachs on the floor with our noses hung over the hole’s
edge. It wasn’t a big hole—not <span class="pageNum" id="pb155">[<a href="#pb155">155</a>]</span>more than six inches in diameter. And to see into the lower room we had to bring the
tops of our heads together, each one sort of pushing forward to hold his place.
</p>
<p>The Harmony Hustler, as he had elected to introduce himself into the house as a part
of his hidden scheme, let on that he was awfully tickled at sight of an old-fashioned
square piano that stood in one corner of the sitting room. He sort of patted it here
and there, even on its big round legs, as though he was wildly in love with every
part of it, calling it a “magnificent old instrument—a patriarch of piano art,” and
a lot of other silly truck like that.
</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” the lock tender spoke up, “if you kin play a tune on it or not. Fur
a rat got in it last winter an’ made a nest in it. An’ one day the ol’ cat she got
a whiff of mister rat an’ got in whar the varmint was, an’ then, let me tell you,
they was <i>some</i> action. By gum, I never heerd sech a whangin’ an’ a bangin’ an’ a discordin’ in all
my born days. They was bass notes an’ sopranny notes an’ rat whiskers an’ cat fuzz
flyin’ every which way.” The speaker paused to spit through the doorway. “The ol’
cat she licked. Yes, sir, by gum, she jest naturally cleaned that ol’ rat’s bones
as slick as a polished darn needle. <span class="pageNum" id="pb156">[<a href="#pb156">156</a>]</span>Smart cat, mister. She hain’t furgot ’bout that ol’ rat, nuther. No, sir. Every day
or so she gits in the pianny an’ goes thumpin’ up an’ down the strings. As I tell
my neighbors, the fust thing I know I’ll have a cat pianny player an’ kin start up
a side show an’ git rich. Purty slick idea, hey? Hee! hee! hee!”
</p>
<p>The Harmony Hustler gave himself a sort of vague look.
</p>
<p>“How—aw—quaint and interesting, sir.”
</p>
<p>“An’ that hain’t all my ol’ cat kin do—you jest watch now.”
</p>
<p>Putting a silver thimble in the middle of the sitting-room floor, the animal’s proud
owner went to the door and called: “Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty!” And pretty soon a
big black and white cat bounded into the room, with an arched back and fluffy tail.
It seemed instantly to get its eyes on the shiny thimble. Pouncing on the silver finger
piece, it took the thimble in its mouth to the furnace register and dropped it through
the iron grating.
</p>
<p>“Meow!” it said, looking up at its beaming master as though in expectation of another
toy.
</p>
<p>“Hain’t that smart?” the lock tender cackled. “Does it every time, by gum! Thimbles
an’ spools an’ buttons—they all go down the register <span class="pageNum" id="pb157">[<a href="#pb157">157</a>]</span>when ol’ Spotty gits a whack at ’em. Eh, Spotty?” and he affectionately rubbed the
purring cat’s arched back.
</p>
<p>“I should imagine, sir, that you—aw—have quite a collection of articles in your furnace
pipe.”
</p>
<p>The cat fondler looked up quickly.
</p>
<p>“Oh!… I git the stuff out ag’in,” he waggled.
</p>
<p>The Harmony Hustler studied the iron grating.
</p>
<p>“By removing the register, I presume.”
</p>
<p>“Naw. I go down cellar an’ reach my arm in the air pipe.”
</p>
<p>There was a momentary queer, smug expression on the visitor’s face as he regarded
the furnace register—a sort of appraising look—then he seated himself on the wabbly
stool and prepared to give the piano a tryout. In the way that he posed, with his
shoulders thrown back and his chin thrust up, I could think of nothing but a conceited
rooster getting ready to crow. Spreading out his long, slim fingers, he brought his
hands down on the keyboard with an awful thump.
</p>
<p>“Tra-<span class="asc">LA</span>-LA-<span class="xd31e2720">LA-<span class="xd31e2720">LA-<i>A-A!”</i></span></span> he boomed, hanging onto the last high “la” until the horrified pictures on the sitting-room
wall bulged their glassy eyes and squirmed in agony. “You have here, as <span class="pageNum" id="pb158">[<a href="#pb158">158</a>]</span>I said a moment ago, sir, a most magnificent old instrument. Tra-<span class="asc">LA</span>-LA-<span class="xd31e2720">LA-<span class="xd31e2720">LA-<i>A-A!”</i></span></span>
</p>
<p>“By gum,” grinned the lock tender, amused at the performance, “you kin make more noise
than the cat.”
</p>
<p>The Harmony Hustler unloaded a dozen or more tools from his bulging pockets and briskly
removed the piano’s wooden top, thus exposing the encased strings. In his work he
kept going “Tra-la-lee-tra-la-lum!” but not at the peak of his voice as he had done
when he was batting the keyboard. He let on that his whole heart was in his work.
But he didn’t fool <i>me</i>. And watching him I wondered why his eyes constantly sought the furnace register.
Was he thinking of the cat? It would seem so.
</p>
<p>Well, the better part of an hour went by. The worker would tighten a string and then
thump its key, seemingly tuning the string to the lilt of his booming voice. Of course
he couldn’t make his voice sound the very high and the very low notes. But he covered
a wide range of the keyboard, let me tell you.
</p>
<p>Finally he straightened from his work.
</p>
<p>“There, sir,” he beamed, posing, <span class="corr" id="xd31e2746" title="Not in source">“</span>the job is done—a Capricorn-Hebrides-Windbigler job, sir, <span class="pageNum" id="pb159">[<a href="#pb159">159</a>]</span>than which—I say it in proper modesty—there is none better.” He jiggled his fingers
around among the keys. “You will notice the vast improvement in the tone of your instrument,
sir—the exquisite harmony. I strike this chord, and the colorful tones conjure up
in our minds a picture of a hidden lane in a deep forest. The damp tang of the woodland
lies heavy in our nostrils. Now we approach a bank of gorgeous yellow tulips. I strike
these minor chords … gently … gently … and we pluck the yellow blossoms, one … by
… one.”
</p>
<p>The lock tender was laughing up his sleeve at the silly performance.
</p>
<p>“By gum, Windbag, they ought to take you an’ make you ’quainted with the inside of
a padded cell.”
</p>
<p>Gathering up his tools, the Harmony Hustler fumbled with a small wrench, letting the
tool fall through the furnace register. Watching him from above, we thought that he
had dropped the wrench by accident. We were soon to learn, however, that the act was
intentional.
</p>
<p>“Dear me! I do believe, sir, that I have lost one of my prized wrenches down your
register.” He got on his knees and peered anxiously through <span class="pageNum" id="pb160">[<a href="#pb160">160</a>]</span>the iron grating. “I seem wholly unable to see it, sir. But I quite assure you that
I heard it fall.”
</p>
<p>The lock tender was grinning at the seemingly distressed one.
</p>
<p>“What be you tryin’ to do?—imitate my cat?”
</p>
<p>“Dear me! What shall I do?”
</p>
<p>“Windbubbler, you’re dumb, if I must say so.”
</p>
<p>“I beg pardon?…”
</p>
<p>“D-u-m-b,” the lock tender spelt. “I mean you don’t know much, outside of a few pianny
tricks.”
</p>
<p>“My dear sir!…”
</p>
<p>The householder waggled in disgust that the other shouldn’t have remembered what he
had said about being able to get into the register pipe from the cellar.
</p>
<p>“Wal, I suppose we’ve got to have all kinds of people in this world, simple an’ otherwise.…
I’ll git your wrench fur you.”
</p>
<p>At the disappearance of the householder into the cellar, the Harmony Hustler got quickly
on his knees and began sounding the piano’s big wooden legs with his knuckles. Working
quickly, he passed to the third leg, the one in back on the right-hand side. Here
he seemed to find what he was searching for. We heard him excitedly catch his breath.
And his hands trembled as he <span class="pageNum" id="pb161">[<a href="#pb161">161</a>]</span>locked them around the big leg, giving it a sharp twist to the left. We saw the leg
turn. He was unscrewing it!
</p>
<p>Following a tinny rattle of furnace pipes in the cellar, heavy steps sounded on the
stairs. Jumping nimbly to his feet, the queer acting one was dreamily running his
snaky fingers up and down the keyboard when the other man came into the room with
the recovered thimble and wrench.
</p>
<p>As I have said, it was my earlier belief that the warty-nosed thief’s visit to the
house had been occasioned by our presence there as prisoners. But now I was made to
realize, from what I had just witnessed, that he was more interested in the marked
piano leg than he was in us. It was to get a chance to secretly inspect the piano’s
legs that he had tricked the instrument’s owner into the cellar.
</p>
<p>Here was a new mystery. What was there in connection with the marked piano leg to
attract the thief to the house? In what way did the marked leg differ from the other
legs? Was it in the sound? And now that the thief had made some kind of a discovery,
what step was he planning to take next?
</p>
<p>Intensely interested in what had taken place in the sitting room, I had given no attention
to <span class="pageNum" id="pb162">[<a href="#pb162">162</a>]</span>my companions, and therefore hadn’t missed Peg at the stovepipe hole.
</p>
<p>But in the disappearance of our jailer into the cellar, our big chum had jumped to
his feet, extracting from the bureau several folded bed sheets. Tearing the sheets
into strips, he had twisted the strips into a rope, one end of which now dangled out
of the window.
</p>
<p>“Come on, fellows,” the worker panted, calling our attention to the way that he had
opened to probable freedom.
</p>
<p>We weren’t blind to the risk that we would run in escaping down the bed-sheet rope.
If we were detected in our descent by our jailer we probably would get a charge of
bird shot in our legs. But in our crazy eagerness to get away from our hated prison
we were willing to run any kind of a risk.
</p>
<p>Before going through the window Red grabbed his pants and shirt, for, as I have said,
we were all more or less undressed. I was slow in finding my pants, so Peg, the next
one dressed, went out through the window and down the rope, scooting, with the freckled
one, in the direction of the underbrush on the canal bank.
</p>
<p>I still hadn’t been able, in my excitement, to find my misplaced pants. So Scoop prepared
to make his escape from the room ahead of me.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb163">[<a href="#pb163">163</a>]</span></p>
<p>Below us the Harmony Hustler was chasing his fingers up and down the keyboard. We
were thankful for the music for it enabled us to go quickly about the room without
the danger of attracting attention to our movements.
</p>
<p>Our jailer, seemingly charmed by the piano’s music, was contentedly rocking back and
forth in a big chair in the middle of the room. I sort of laughed to myself as I squinted
at him through the stovepipe hole. We were putting it over on him! I could imagine
his later bellowing rage at the discovery of our clever flight.
</p>
<p><i>Bang!</i>
</p>
<p>I almost jumped out of my skin at the crashing sound.
</p>
<p>“Hey!” our jailer roared from below, leaping to his feet. “What in Sam Hill be you
kids doin’ up thar?”
</p>
<p>In preparing to climb over the sill, Scoop clumsily had let the window fall. Frantic,
he was now trying to raise it, so that we could make our escape down the rope before
our jailer got into the room. But the window had stuck tightly in its sharp fall.
He couldn’t budge it.
</p>
<p>I saw in a flash that we were trapped. Our predicament filled me with shivers. We
would suffer double, Scoop and I, for our luckier companions’ <span class="pageNum" id="pb164">[<a href="#pb164">164</a>]</span>escape. In his rage, our jailer might even turn his shotgun on us.
</p>
<p>I didn’t want to be shot. It was an awful thought. And in a panic I darted my horrified
eyes around the room for a possible barricade. The bed! My eyes came to it and stopped.
I had hid under beds more than once in my lifetime! And here was an especially good
bed to hide under, for its white fringed spread hung low on the sides.
</p>
<p>The jailer turned the key in the door’s lock. But in the time that the door was being
thrown open, I vanished, pantless, Scoop after me, under the bed.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Jumpin’ Jupiter! Great balls of fire! The little scallawags has escaped!”
</p>
<p>Scoop nudged me under the bed as our furious jailer tore up and down the room like
a crazy man.
</p>
<p>I knew what was in my companion’s mind. He was tickled in the thought that it had
been taken for granted, from the seeming vacancy of the room, that we had vanished
from our prison.
</p>
<p>The crazy acting one was now at the window.
</p>
<p>“Yes, sir, by gum, they made a rope out of my best bed sheets—the little villains!—an’
got away through the windy. What do you know about that? An’ me a-sittin’ downstairs
all the while with my hands folded like a’ ol’ dumb-bell. My best sheets! <i>Wough!</i> If I had my hands on ’em I’d shake the pants off em, by gum. Yes, sir.… <i>Hey!</i> What’s this? A pair of pants! An’ after me sayin’.… Money in the pockets, too. <span class="pageNum" id="pb166">[<a href="#pb166">166</a>]</span>Five, ten, twenty, twenty-five, thirty dollars. An’ here’s eight more dollars in another
pocket.”
</p>
<p>Scoop made a queer throat sound.
</p>
<p>“Jerry, is he counting <i>our</i> money?”
</p>
<p>“I guess so,” I whispered back, miserable in the loss of our working capital and profits.
He had my eight dollars, too.
</p>
<p>“What in the dickens did you drop your pants for? If you aren’t a peach!”
</p>
<p>I stiffened.
</p>
<p>“Huh! Who let the window drop?”
</p>
<p>That shut him up.
</p>
<p>“Lookit all the money I’ve got,” our jailer cackled, when the Harmony Hustler came
hesitatingly into the room.
</p>
<p>“Well, well!”
</p>
<p>“One of the kids was in sech a hurry to clean out that he furgot his pants. I found
the money in the pocket.”
</p>
<p>“Did you have some boys confined in this room, sir?”
</p>
<p>The lock tender must have nodded in answer to the question.
</p>
<p>“That’s what makes me feel so all-fired cheap—to be done this way by a parcel of boys
in knee pants.”
</p>
<p>“I wonder.…” The Harmony Hustler <span class="pageNum" id="pb167">[<a href="#pb167">167</a>]</span>paused. “May I inquire, sir, if your prisoners were four youths in charge of a show
boat?”
</p>
<p>Scoop got my ear.
</p>
<p>“He hasn’t forgotten us, Jerry.”
</p>
<p>The lock tender must have answered the other man with another nod.
</p>
<p>“I’ve got their boat. An’ I’m a-goin’ to put a chain an’ padlock on it an’ keep it,
by gum, till their fathers come here an’ settle with me fur the loss of my sheets.…
If you be intendin’ to stay here all night, mister, this is your room. Better raise
the windy an’ let some fresh air in. Gits awful hot up here in the afternoon. Wal,
I’ve got to ’phone to my brother that the little imps has escaped. Drat the luck!
My best sheets, too!”
</p>
<p>Listening to the grumbler thump down the stairs, I could not doubt, after what he
had said, that he had taken my pants with him. Certainly he had our money. The Harmony
Hustler remained in the room. We could hear him trying to raise the window. After
a lot of grunting and thumping he finally succeeded.
</p>
<p>I was braced up in the thought that we still had a chance to escape, this in the event
that Peg’s rope wasn’t taken away. As soon as it got dusk we could slide down the
rope to freedom. Of <span class="pageNum" id="pb168">[<a href="#pb168">168</a>]</span>course, I would be pantless in my flight, and our show money would, of necessity,
be left behind. But I told myself, in looking ahead, that the double loss of my pants
and the show money wasn’t necessarily a thing to worry about. Getting safely out of
our prison was the big thought.
</p>
<p>The Harmony Hustler moved here and there in the room, arranging the chairs to his
satisfaction and fussing with the bed clothing. We couldn’t see what he was doing,
but I had the idea that he was turning the top covers back, as Mother does with my
bed at home to make it easy for me to get into.
</p>
<p>Below us, the lock tender was getting supper. We could smell frying ham. There was
a rumbling as of a cranked coffee grinder. After a few minutes the pleasing aroma
of boiling coffee was added to the appetizing ham smell. In the further course of
the supper preparations there was a thump! thump! that told us that potatoes were
being mashed in the kettle. I had heard the same sound in our kitchen any number of
times and instantly recognized it.
</p>
<p>Mashed potatoes and ham gravy! My mouth watered in the thought of it.
</p>
<p>“Hey, Windfeller!”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb169">[<a href="#pb169">169</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Yes, sir,” the Harmony Hustler promptly called back.
</p>
<p>“Be you wantin’ canned-cherry sauce fur supper, or mincemeat pie?”
</p>
<p>“I—aw—am very partial to pie, sir.”
</p>
<p>Scoop was holding his stomach.
</p>
<p>“Oh!…” he groaned in my ear. “Can you smell the ham, Jerry?”
</p>
<p>“Don’t talk about it,” I whispered back, in added misery.
</p>
<p>“And mincemeat pie!”
</p>
<p>“Shut up.”
</p>
<p>“If I don’t get something to eat pretty soon,” he groaned, “I’m done for.”
</p>
<p>We could now talk above a whisper for we had the bedroom to ourselves. We even put
our heads out of our stuffy hiding place to get a breath of cooler air.
</p>
<p>“Jerry, the rope’s gone!”
</p>
<p>I let out my neck and took a squint at the window.
</p>
<p>“The piano fellow must have taken it downstairs,” Scoop added, groaning in despair.
</p>
<p>I told myself that I wouldn’t give up.
</p>
<p>“We can make another rope,” I hung on doggedly.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb170">[<a href="#pb170">170</a>]</span></p>
<p>“I’m not so sure about that. For if we give the least sound of our presence up here
we’re done for.”
</p>
<p>There was truth in that, all right. And depression descended upon me in spite of all
that I could do to ward it off.
</p>
<p>Night came. But if I had had any remaining small hope of being able to make another
bed-sheet rope, to escape through the window after the manner of Red and Peg, I was
doomed to disappointment. For the lock tender and his over-night guest never left
the room below us. As a result we had to lay motionless under the bed. For a single
suspicious creak of the floor could very easily have led to our undoing.
</p>
<p>Our former jailer—I had quit regarding him as our jailer in fact, now that he had
no knowledge of our presence in the house—had tried earlier in the day to get a telephone
connection with his brother in Ashton. Failing, he had left word for the other to
call back. So about eight o’clock the telephone bell rang. There was considerable
excited conversation between the two brothers, chiefly to the point that we had escaped.
</p>
<p>“Their boat’s still here,” the deputy concluded, “an’ I’ve got the pants belongin’
to one of ’em. If they come back to-night to try an’ git away <span class="pageNum" id="pb171">[<a href="#pb171">171</a>]</span>with their boat, I’ll fix ’em, by gum! They can’t git away without me hearin’ ’em.
The little scallawags!”
</p>
<p>The attic room was cooler now. But I doubt if our misery was made any the lighter
by the lessened heat. For we still had our empty stomachs and parched mouths to contend
with.
</p>
<p>It was our plan now to wait until the household was asleep and then tiptoe down the
stairs to freedom. We would make some noise in our descent of the stairs, that was
unavoidable, but it was our hope that whatever slight sounds we made would pass undetected
in the others’ slumber.
</p>
<p>In our nervous impatience to make our escape, it seemed to us that the lock tender
and his guest never would go to bed. Our former jailer, playing the part of the host,
brought out a checker board at the conclusion of his telephone conversation, and until
upwards of ten-thirty the two men bent to their game, winning turn about.
</p>
<p>Finally, though, to our tremendous relief, the lower doors were locked for the night
and the Harmony Hustler mounted the stairs with a hand lamp. Upon his entrance into
the bedroom he made a pretense of going to bed by dropping his removed shoes on the
floor, after which, in continuation <span class="pageNum" id="pb172">[<a href="#pb172">172</a>]</span>of his trick, he moved here and there in the room in his stocking feet. The trick
completed, he quickly dressed his feet and blew out the light.
</p>
<p>Boy, I was scared! It was bad enough to be in the room with him when we could see
him; it was a thousand times worse to be shut up with him in the dark.
</p>
<p>Suppose he put a snaky hand under the bed and touched me! I shivered in the thought
of it.
</p>
<p>“Jerry!” Scoop breathed in my ear.
</p>
<p>I jumped in my nervousness.
</p>
<p>“Did he touch you?” I gurgled.
</p>
<p>“Touch me? Of course not. Can’t you see him? He’s watching the lock tender through
the stovepipe hole.”
</p>
<p>I changed my position ever so slightly, careful to make no sound. And sure enough,
as Scoop had said, the room’s other occupant was on his hands and knees over the hole
in the floor. The light from below shone on his tense face. A crouching killer! I
could think of nothing else in the expression of his face and the suggestive posture
of his body.
</p>
<p>“Maybe he’s going to kill the old man,” I shivered, recalling stories I had read.
</p>
<p>“Why should he do that?”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb173">[<a href="#pb173">173</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Why should he hug the piano leg?” I countered.
</p>
<p>“You think he wants the piano leg bad enough to commit murder to get it?”
</p>
<p>“Look at his face,” I returned. “If he isn’t a killer, I never hope to see one.”
</p>
<p>“Um.…” reflected Scoop. “I’m curious about that piano leg, Jerry. Maybe it’s made
of gold and painted to look like wood.”
</p>
<p>“Don’t talk so loud,” I shivered. “He’ll hear you.”
</p>
<p>“I’d like to know what his scheme is.”
</p>
<p>“Sh-h-h-h!”
</p>
<p>“What are we going to do if he starts downstairs with a knife? We can’t let him murder
the old man in his bed.”
</p>
<p>“We can yell.”
</p>
<p>“You poor fish!”
</p>
<p>“If I was to yell the way I want to yell,” I shivered, “I’d scare him dead in his
tracks.”
</p>
<p>There was a moment’s silence.
</p>
<p>“I wonder where Red and Peg are.”
</p>
<p>“Probably in Steam Corners eating licorice … if Red has any money.”
</p>
<p>“I don’t believe they’re in Steam Corners. I’d sooner think they’re hiding at the
canal bank, waiting for us.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb174">[<a href="#pb174">174</a>]</span></p>
<p>This remark brought to my mind the white-haired man. We had thought that <i>he</i> was waiting near by with the recovered bonds. But that, I now concluded, couldn’t
very well be the case. The warty-nosed man wouldn’t have put up here for the night
if his accomplice was waiting for him outside.
</p>
<p>Below us the lock tender was pottering from room to room, talking to the black and
white cat and making certain that the doors had all been locked. Finally he went into
his bedroom. He wasn’t going to undress, he told the cat, for he was of the belief
that “them blasted b’ys,” as he called us, would be back after the boat.
</p>
<p>Having got into bed, he happened to remember that he hadn’t wound the clock, so up
he got again, pottering into the sitting room. The clock properly wound, he returned
to his bed, only to remember, after a brief interval, that he had neglected to put
a rug over the furnace register, to prevent the cat from doing any thimble dropping
in the course of the night.
</p>
<p>Finally a deep silence settled throughout the house. Ten-twenty-thirty minutes passed.
There was not the slightest sound from the watcher at the stovepipe hole, though,
of course, in the now darkened house, the man was using his ears and <span class="pageNum" id="pb175">[<a href="#pb175">175</a>]</span>not his eyes. He was listening, I knew, for possible sounds from the lower bedroom
that would tell him that the bed’s occupant had finally dropped asleep.
</p>
<p>I was sort of nodding myself. But the pressure of Scoop’s hand on my arm put me wide
awake again.
</p>
<p>“Come on, Jerry. Now’s our chance.”
</p>
<p>My mind held a horrified picture of the crouching killer at the stovepipe hole.
</p>
<p>“You’re crazy,” I gasped, in a panic of fear in the thought of leaving our hiding
place.
</p>
<p>“It’s now or never. He’s likely to wake up any moment.”
</p>
<p>“Is he asleep?” I breathed, in surprise.
</p>
<p>“Sure thing. I can tell by his deep breathing.… Come on.”
</p>
<p>Well, I don’t mind telling you that my heart was in my throat, sort of, as we crawled
like snails from under the bed and tiptoed across the room to the door. The moonlight
guided our steps. It revealed, too, the sleeping form of the killer. His back was
against the wall and he sort of leaned to one side against a chair. It wouldn’t take
much to awaken him, for we realized that he had dropped to sleep by accident. As Scoop
had said, there was need for quick work on our part.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb176">[<a href="#pb176">176</a>]</span></p>
<p>The bedroom door creaked ever so slightly as we opened it. And at the sound my heart
stopped pumping until I had made sure that the sleeper hadn’t been disturbed. I felt
safer when we were in the hall. If necessary we could make a run for it now.
</p>
<p>In the moonlit lower room we had to pass the open door of the lock tender’s chamber.
He would surely see us if he was awake. However, from his deep, even breathing we
concluded that <i>he</i> was asleep, too.
</p>
<p>We got to the door and slowly turned the key in the lock. I gave a glad sigh when
the door swung open. There was nothing between us and positive freedom now.
</p>
<p>Scoop paused.
</p>
<p>“Jerry,” he whispered hoarsely, “I’ve got to have a drink. My mouth’s on fire.”
</p>
<p>I went with him to the kitchen, for, as I have said, I, too, was suffering from burning
thirst. And did water ever taste as good to me as it did then! Oh, boy! There was
a pan of red apples on the kitchen table. We filled our pockets—that is, Scoop filled
<i>his</i> pockets. You must remember that <i>I</i> had no pockets to fill except a small shirt pocket.
</p>
<p>While we were in the kitchen Scoop got his <span class="pageNum" id="pb177">[<a href="#pb177">177</a>]</span>eyes on the lock tender’s long white nightshirt. It lay on a kitchen chair, where
its owner had probably dropped it, after having arrived at the determination to sleep
in his clothes.
</p>
<p>“ ‘A fair exchange is no robbery,’ ” the leader quoted, handing me the nightshirt.
“Take it along, Jerry,” he grinned. “You may need it. And later you can trade even-up
with the old gent for your pants.”
</p>
<p>I was crazy to get out of the house; and rather than argue with the other about the
nightshirt I rolled it up and put it under my arm. But I had no intention of using
it. I’d look sweet, I told myself, parading around the landscape in old thing-a-ma-bob’s
nightshirt. Nothin’ doin’!
</p>
<p>Scoop was feeling more like himself now that he had gotten on the outside of a dipperful
of water. And instead of going cautiously through the sitting room he strutted along
in his most daring way, acting as though he owned the whole house and didn’t care
a rap for anybody or anything.
</p>
<p>“Um.…” he mumbled, stopping at the piano.
</p>
<p>“Come on,” I breathed, tugging anxiously at his arm.
</p>
<p>“Just a minute.” He got down on his knees <span class="pageNum" id="pb178">[<a href="#pb178">178</a>]</span>and squinted at the marked piano leg, thumping it with his knuckles in the way the
killer had done. “I wish I had a light. Skip into the kitchen, Jerry, and get some
matches.”
</p>
<p>“Not on your life. Come on.”
</p>
<p>He had hold of the leg with his hands.
</p>
<p>“I can turn it!”
</p>
<p>A foot scraped on the floor directly over our heads.
</p>
<p>“It’ll be your last ‘turn,’ ” I shivered, conscious of a pair of burning eyes in the
stovepipe hole, “if you don’t hurry and get out of here.”
</p>
<p>“I’ve got it. Boy! It weighs a ton.”
</p>
<p>Whang! <i>Bang!!</i> CRASH!!! <i>BING!</i>
</p>
<p>“It’s the cat!” screeched Scoop, leaping to his feet. “Beat it, Jerry. Here comes
old blunder-buss.”
</p>
<p>We went out of the house like a streak, my daring companion in the lead with the piano
leg under his arm and me hot on his flying heels. Behind us we could hear the killer
bounding down the stairs. The lock tender, in his bedroom, was roaring at the top
of his voice.
</p>
<p>Did you ever read the story about Jack, the boy who climbed the beanstalk? If you
have you will remember the part where the hero was escaping from the giant’s castle
with the singing harp. <span class="pageNum" id="pb179">[<a href="#pb179">179</a>]</span>The harp, not wanting to be stolen, had awakened the giant by crying: “Master! Master!”
</p>
<p>Well, I had a skidding thought of Jack’s flight with the harp as we made off with
the lock tender’s piano leg. For back in the house the piano was yelling for its master
as loudly as the black and white cat could make it.
</p>
<p>We were now out of sight of the house. And realizing that the moonlight would show
us up if we tried to escape down the tow path, we wisely dove into the heavy underbrush.
Panting, our hearts pounding in the excitement of our escape, we lay on the ground,
sort of tuning in on the shouting voices of our pursuers.
</p>
<p>In a moment or two the running lock tender came into sight. He had his shotgun. Dad
told me afterwards that I needn’t have been in fear of the gun—he said that the man
wouldn’t have dared to have used it on us. But I’m not so sure about that. A man as
crazy as the lock tender was is liable, in his excitement, to do anything.
</p>
<p>The evil-faced killer came into sight, panting and sort of clawing the air with his
working hands.
</p>
<p>“It’s them pesky b’ys,” our former jailer roared, having paused near our hiding place.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb180">[<a href="#pb180">180</a>]</span>“How they got in the house, though, is more ’an <i>I</i> know.”
</p>
<p>“We’ve got to capture them, sir,” the other panted hoarsely.
</p>
<p>“Wal, you blamed idiot, I’m tryin’ to capture ’em, hain’t I?”
</p>
<p>“They’ve stolen your piano leg, sir.”
</p>
<p>“<i>What?</i>”
</p>
<p>“A leg of your piano is missing, sir.”
</p>
<p>The lock tender set his gun down and gave a coarse, jerky laugh.
</p>
<p>“Wal, by gum! A pianny leg! Whoever heerd tell of anybody stealin’ a pianny leg?”
</p>
<p>They went on down the tow path in the hope of catching possible sight of us. After
ten or fifteen minutes they hurried back. Now was our chance to get away. And scrambling
to our feet we started down the tow path in the direction of the wide waters lickety-cut.
</p>
<p>When we were a good mile from the lock we stopped to rest and sort of plan things.
First of all we had the job of finding our pals. Our conclusion was that they had
not gone to Steam Corners. The island was the place for us to head for, though how
we were going to cross the water without a boat was more than we knew in the moment.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb181">[<a href="#pb181">181</a>]</span></p>
<p>“We might use the piano leg for a raft,” I joked, holding up the big leg and sort
of squinting at it curious-like in the moonlight.
</p>
<p>“Gosh!” laughed Scoop. “I had almost forgotten that it was here.”
</p>
<p>I made an amazing discovery.
</p>
<p>“Lookit!” I yipped, holding up a roll of greenbacks that I had found in the leg’s
hollow stomach.
</p>
<p>Yes, sir, it was <i>real</i> money. Not one-dollar and two-dollar bills, either, but tens and twenties—dozens
and dozens of them, rolled tightly together.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb182">[<a href="#pb182">182</a>]</span></p>

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h2 class="main">BACK TO THE ISLAND</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In unscrewing the marked leg of the lock tender’s old fashioned piano, it had not
been the intention of my curious companion to run off with it. For he had no right
to do that. It was stealing, sort of. Certainly, as he admitted to me later on, he
wouldn’t have taken the leg out of its owner’s house if he had known that it was full
of money.
</p>
<p>He had been led to the piano leg out of curiosity. Having seen the Harmony Hustler
turn it, <i>he</i> had wanted to turn it. That, he had concluded, was the way into its secret.
</p>
<p>But whatever scattered ideas he and I may have had bearing on the leg’s probable secret,
I can truthfully state that our discovery of the money was a smashing surprise. We
hadn’t dreamed of a thing like this. And had we made the discovery of the roll of
greenbacks while in the house the chances are that we would have dropped the leg in
a hurry. For it would have <span class="pageNum" id="pb183">[<a href="#pb183">183</a>]</span>been our natural thought that here was the piano owner’s hoardings. The piano leg
was his savings bank.
</p>
<p>But it was a mighty lucky thing, as we found out later on, that we did sort of run
off unintentionally with the piano leg, to learn, when our excitement in our escape
had somewhat subsided, of its surprising contents. For in the act we saved the money
from falling into the killer’s thieving hands. More than that we probably saved a
man’s life.
</p>
<p>We knew now that the money didn’t belong to the lock tender. For he had shown no excitement
when he had been told, within our hearing, that a leg of his piano had been stolen.
Had he known that the missing leg was full of money—<i>his</i> money—he would have been crazily excited. We had no doubt on that point.
</p>
<p>The killer, on the other hand, <i>did</i> know about the money. And in short thought it could have been concluded therefrom
that the hidden greenbacks were his. But in our deep distrust of him we didn’t accept
the first thought that came into our heads. It was true that he had shown a knowledge
of the hidden money, but he had shown, too, in his investigation of the piano’s legs,
a definite lack of knowledge of the money’s <span class="pageNum" id="pb184">[<a href="#pb184">184</a>]</span>exact hiding place. This was conclusive in our minds that he hadn’t hidden the money
himself. Therefore, we argued, the money wasn’t his.
</p>
<p>We had not the slightest intention of returning the greenbacks to the lock tender.
Why should we when they didn’t belong to him? If he once got his hands on the fortune
he would <i>say</i> that the money was his. We had little more belief in his honesty than we had in the
killer’s, and certainly, insofar as we were able to prevent it, the latter was to
be given no chance at the money.
</p>
<p>The thing to do, we decided, was to keep the money and turn it over to the law, together
with a detailed explanation of how it had come into our possession. The law, in fairness
to all concerned, would see that the money passed into the hands of its rightful owner.
I might add here, in all frankness, that we were not without hope that some share
of the money would be awarded to us. We felt that we were earning a right to a part
of it.
</p>
<p>We counted the greenbacks by the light of the moon, thus learning that the roll consisted
of thirty twenty-dollar bills and forty ten-dollar bills—an even thousand dollars!
</p>
<p>Of the opinion that the money was no longer <span class="pageNum" id="pb185">[<a href="#pb185">185</a>]</span>safe in the hollow of the piano leg, Scoop stuffed three hundred dollars into each
of his two side pockets, dividing the balance into two rolls of two hundred dollars
each, which he put away in his two hip pockets. He told me in the conclusion of the
money’s distribution that he felt like a walking safe. And I could imagine that he
did, all right. For it isn’t every day in a fellow’s life that he has a chance to
pocket a thousand dollars.
</p>
<p>In resting we had disposed of our apples, sorry, in our hollow hunger, that we hadn’t
more of them to eat. The food gave us new pep. Starting out again in our passage to
the big wide waters, we took turns carrying the heavy piano leg, which was to back
us up in our story when we came before the law.
</p>
<p>The big sum of money in our possession was an anxiety to us, and, as can be imagined,
we kept a constant eye ahead of us and behind us. Once in looking back I thought I
detected a man of the killer’s size in the shadow of the trees. We hid in the underbrush
at the next turn in the tow path. But no one overtook us. So it was concluded that
what I had mistaken for a man in my nervousness was probably a bush or a tall tree
stump.
</p>
<p>Where was the white-haired man? Were Red <span class="pageNum" id="pb186">[<a href="#pb186">186</a>]</span>and Peg on his trail? Had he recovered the bonds, as we had concluded, and was he
now far away from the island? Or was he, for some reason or purpose unknown to us,
still in hiding near by?
</p>
<p>I could only speculate in my mind regarding the probable answers to these questions.
Nor had I any answer to the riddle of why the two thieves had separated. We knew where
one of the evil pair was. The thought of a possible sudden meeting with the other
one in the moonlit tow path filled me with shivers.
</p>
<p>Scoop got his eyes on me.
</p>
<p>“What’s the matter, Jerry? Are you cold?”
</p>
<p>“Cold and scared both,” I admitted, my teeth chattering.
</p>
<p>He looked me over.
</p>
<p>“I should think you would be cold in your underwear and shoes. Why don’t you put on
the nightshirt?”
</p>
<p>“Aw!…”
</p>
<p>“Go ahead. Shucks! What do you care how you look?” he urged, reading my thoughts.
</p>
<p>None of us had been wearing stockings with our shoes. And I realized now that my bare
legs were colder in the damp night air than I had imagined. So I acted on the other’s
advice and <span class="pageNum" id="pb187">[<a href="#pb187">187</a>]</span>got into the long white nightshirt. It was a big help to me, I found, in keeping my
legs warm.
</p>
<p>Coming to the big wide waters, we had a moonlight view of the island to our right.
A thing that puzzled us was the occasional flicker of a campfire on the rise where
the bonds had been buried. While we were discussing the campfire a rowboat came into
sight around the head of the island. For all we knew to the contrary the boat’s occupant
was an officer bent on our capture. So the thing for us to do, we wisely concluded,
was to get out of sight.
</p>
<p>After an elapse of several minutes we detected the sound of oarlocks. We could hear,
too, in the approach of the boat, the intermittent swish! swish! of the rower’s blades
as they bit into the water. It appeared that the boat was heading up the canal in
the direction of the lock where we had been held prisoners. This strengthened our
belief that the rower was probably the Ashton policeman, on his way to his brother’s
house.
</p>
<p>“I’m hungry,” a low voice complained.
</p>
<p>“Huh!” came another and gruffer voice. “You’re always hungry.”
</p>
<p>“I haven’t had any supper.”
</p>
<p>“Nor have we. But you don’t hear us growling about it.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb188">[<a href="#pb188">188</a>]</span></p>
<p>“I wish I was home.”
</p>
<p>My companion put a quick hand on my arm.
</p>
<p>“Recognize that yap, Jerry?”
</p>
<p>“It’s Red Meyers.”
</p>
<p>“Sure thing.”
</p>
<p>We guardedly put up our heads to get a better view of the boat’s passengers. It was
our chums, all right! The girl was in the boat, too. My heart gave a happy bound.
</p>
<p>At our signal Peg brought the boat quickly to shore, as tickled to see us as we were
to see him.
</p>
<p>I was a bit backward about showing myself in front of the girl in my ridiculous gown.
I didn’t want her to think that I was foolish.
</p>
<p>Scoop read my embarrassment in my actions.
</p>
<p>“Miss Garber,” he introduced in mock gravity, dragging me into sight, “allow me to
present to you my charming friend, Miss Pansy Blossom.”
</p>
<p>Red forgot all about his hollow stomach in my confusion.
</p>
<p>“ ‘Miss Pansy Blossom!’ ” he hooted. “Haw! haw! haw!”
</p>
<p>Joining Scoop in the fun of the nonsensical introduction, the girl gave me her hand
in a sort of stylish-like way, telling me the while that it was indeed a great pleasure
for her to make the acquaintance of “Miss Pansy Blossom.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb189">[<a href="#pb189">189</a>]</span></p>
<p>The joke was on me, all right. And I decided on the instant that the best way out
of the embarrassing situation would be to pretend as much hilarity and fun in my crazy
appearance as the others.
</p>
<p>Well, in getting down to business, we told our chums the story of our spectacular
flight from the lock tender’s house with the piano leg. There was amazement in their
eyes, and in the girl’s eyes, at sight of our money.
</p>
<p>Then Peg told us of his and Red’s movements since their escape down the rope. They
had waited for us in the underbrush. When we had failed to appear, and they had been
made to realize from the vanished rope that we had been shut off in our intended escape,
they had held guarded counsel, thus deciding to go to the island to learn if the girl
were still there. It had been their further plan to return to the lock at dusk to
help us to possible freedom.
</p>
<p>Arriving at the wide waters, the big one had fashioned a sort of bathing suit of his
underwear and shirt and had swum to the island, where he had promptly come in contact
with the girl, informing her in the meeting of the attack upon her grandfather and
of her position in the tangle. The white-haired uncle, the swimmer had learned <span class="pageNum" id="pb190">[<a href="#pb190">190</a>]</span>in turn, had not been to the island, nor had the warty-nosed man been there.
</p>
<p>“I told Lizzie,” Peg concluded, “that the thing for us to do, now that her grandfather
was in the hospital, was to dig up the bonds and get them into a bank as soon as we
could. Then her uncle wouldn’t be able to steal them. She agreed to the suggestion.
And if we had dug up the bonds <i>then</i>, everything would have been lovely. Instead, I borrowed her boat, which was hidden
in the shore willows at the head of the island, and rowed to the tow path for Red.
</p>
<p>“And now comes the sad part,” freckle-nose put in, wagging his head.
</p>
<p>There was an anxious look on Scoop’s tired face.
</p>
<p>“What happened?” he inquired in a somewhat dull voice, plainly prepared to hear the
worst.
</p>
<p>“In the time that we were away,” Peg continued, “campers landed on the island from
down the canal. The Stricker gang. Seven of them. We had a time getting back to our
harbor unseen.”
</p>
<p>“The dickens!” Scoop cried, with troubled eyes. He looked at me. “That explains the
campfire, Jerry.”
</p>
<p>“Returning to the island,” Peg went on, “we <span class="pageNum" id="pb191">[<a href="#pb191">191</a>]</span>lay in hiding, in the hope that the enemy would leave the place long enough for us
to climb the knoll and dig up the bonds. No such good luck, though. Not only were
the others in complete possession of the island, but they actually pitched their tents
on the knoll over the buried bonds.”
</p>
<p>The leader was staring open-mouthed.
</p>
<p>“What’s that?” he cried.
</p>
<p>“I say,” Peg repeated patiently, “that Bid Stricker’s tent is set up directly over
the spot where we buried the bonds. Of course he doesn’t know that the bonds are there.
And it is well for our purpose that he doesn’t.”
</p>
<p>It was news to Scoop and me that a reward of two hundred dollars had been offered
by the Ashton police department for information that would lead to the granddaughter’s
arrest and to the subsequent recovery of the stolen bonds. Peg and the others had
learned of the reward by listening, unseen, to the campers’ conversation.
</p>
<p>“It’s still the crazy belief of the police,” the big one went on, “that Lizzie tried
to murder her grandfather. And it was largely on her account that Red and I held back
on the Strickers. For we didn’t want to run the chance of defeat and have them drag
her off to jail in order to claim the reward.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb192">[<a href="#pb192">192</a>]</span></p>
<p>Scoop got the granddaughter’s eyes.
</p>
<p>“You needn’t worry,” he said quickly, “about going to jail. For your story of your
uncle’s presence in the house at the time of the assault will clear you.”
</p>
<p>“That’s what I told her,” Peg waggled. “She’s anxious, of course, to get back to town
… she wants to be with her grandfather. And to that point I was hopeful that we all
would be able to say good-by to the island before dusk. With the recovered bonds in
our <span class="corr" id="xd31e3135" title="Source: possesssion">possession</span>, it was planned that Red was to go to town with the girl in the boat while I headed
for the lock to help you fellows. But, as I say, the Strickers were constantly in
our way. And when it came eleven o’clock, and we were no nearer to getting the bonds
than we had been at sundown, I told the others that we had best head for the lock.
We owed you our help. And if we could free you, we would then have your help.”
</p>
<p>Red laughed.
</p>
<p>“We found out something else by listening in on the Strickers’ gab.”
</p>
<p>“Well?” Scoop encouraged.
</p>
<p>“Remember the night they came to the boat, intending to smash up our show truck?”
</p>
<p>“Sure thing. Jerry and Peg were on guard.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb193">[<a href="#pb193">193</a>]</span></p>
<p>“They saw a ghost, all right.”
</p>
<p>“It was the sudden appearance of the ghost on the boat,” Peg put in, “that scared
them away.”
</p>
<p>Scoop laughed in a reflective way.
</p>
<p>“Our ‘friendly ghost’! I’d like to know who this spooky person is who has taken such
a shine to us. Did you hear them say what the ghost looked like?”
</p>
<p>“They described it as being tall and white. When it came over the side of the boat,
out of the canal, sort of, they beat it, scared out of their wits.”
</p>
<p>Scoop got his eyes on me.
</p>
<p>“If they get a look at you In that outfit, Jerry—I beg pardon,” he bowed, grinning,
“I mean Miss Pansy Blossom—they’ll think they’re seeing another ghost.”
</p>
<p>Matching his grin with one of my own I sort of posed in my fancy gown. It wasn’t an
embarrassment to me now, as it had been on the start.
</p>
<p>Peg gave a gesture of impatience.
</p>
<p>“Let’s cut out the nonsense,” he suggested, serious. “For we’ve got a man’s size job
on our hands tonight in getting the bonds. This is our last chance, fellows. For a
dozen cops will be nosing around here to-morrow.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb194">[<a href="#pb194">194</a>]</span></p>
<p>Scoop was looking at me steadily, his eyes sort of narrowed and probing. Laughing
in the conclusion of his thoughts, he started for the boat.
</p>
<p>“Come on, Miss Pansy Blossom,” he beckoned to me. “This is your busy night.”
</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” I inquired quickly.
</p>
<p>But I couldn’t get him to expose his thoughts. All the way to the island he kept going,
“Tra-la-lee-tra-la-lum!” in imitation of the piano tuner. And at intervals he would
look at me and laugh.
</p>
<p>I saw that he was up to some scheme bearing on the recovery of the buried bonds from
under Bid Stricker’s tent. I couldn’t imagine what the scheme was. But plainly I was
involved in it.
</p>
<p>I was not without anxiety in the prospect of what lay ahead of me.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb195">[<a href="#pb195">195</a>]</span></p>

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h2 class="main">WHAT THE TURTLE DID TO ME</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Peg told us that the Strickers’ camp was without a guard, but, even so, it was wise
for us, we concluded, to approach the island in secrecy. For in a boys’ camp it is
not uncommon at night for some wakeful or hungry one to be abroad in search of fun
or food. I’ve frequently done it myself. And I could tell of tricks that have been
played on me when supposedly every member of the camp was asleep like myself. It would
seem from listening ashore that all of the members of this camp were asleep. But,
as I say, we took no chances.
</p>
<p>It was now close to midnight. The moon, as we drew near to the silent island’s east
end, was almost directly over our heads. I was glad from the bottom of my heart that
the moon was out. For its fat glistening face gave us a protecting wide range of vision
in all directions.
</p>
<p>What would the killer do, I wondered, now <span class="pageNum" id="pb196">[<a href="#pb196">196</a>]</span>that he had been foiled, sort of, in his intended evil scheme of stealing the piano
leg’s greenbacks? Would he, in fear of what we might have to tell about him, get quickly
out of the country? Or would he try to run us down, in continued determination to
get the money?
</p>
<p>One thing in our favor, he didn’t know in which direction we had made our escape,
whether to the east, toward Steam Corners, or to the west. So he would have no certain
knowledge of where to turn to put his hands on us. And to start searching for us in
the canal’s extended wilderness without a clew to our probable whereabouts would be
like trying to find the needle that was lost in the haystack.
</p>
<p>It was more probable, I told myself, that he would keep close to the lock tender’s
dock, in the thought that we would be likely to return to the lock to try and recover
our show boat. If he held to that possible plan we were safer still. For we had not
the slightest intention of trying to get possession of the scow. That, we had sensibly
concluded, was a job for our fathers, particularly <i>my</i> father, the boat’s owner. <i>Our</i> job, instead of scheming and fighting for the boat, was to get back to Tutter with
the greenbacks and the bonds. Then the law, as represented by the lock tender <span class="pageNum" id="pb197">[<a href="#pb197">197</a>]</span>and his brother, could sort of settle with us through our parents.
</p>
<p>At sight of the piano leg in the boat I fell to wondering to whom the greenbacks that
we had found belonged. The lock tender had said in our hearing that he had bought
the piano at a second-hand sale. As he seemed to know nothing about the hidden greenbacks,
the money undoubtedly had been contained in the hollow leg when he had brought the
piano home. This led to the logical conclusion that the money belonged to the piano’s
former owner. Yet it was puzzling to me to understand why a man, after having secreted
a thousand dollars in bills in the leg of his piano, should turn around and sell the
instrument for little or nothing. And it was equally puzzling to comprehend how the
killer had come into his knowledge of the hidden money.
</p>
<p>Suppose the law couldn’t locate the piano’s former owner? Would the money in that
event be ours? Hot dog! I said to myself, thinking of the fun we could have with a
thousand dollars.
</p>
<p>Arriving at the island we placed the boat in charge of the girl, cautioning her not
to leave it or to move it. Then we proceeded single file up the rocky slope to the
knoll where the enemy was in camp. Coming to the entrance to the hermit’s <span class="pageNum" id="pb198">[<a href="#pb198">198</a>]</span>cave, Scoop turned in, signaling to us to wait for him. In a moment or two he returned
from the cave with a three-foot length of rope that I remembered seeing on the cave’s
sandy floor the preceding day.
</p>
<p>“It’s a good thing for my scheme,” he laughed, starting to untwist the rope’s strands,
“that the Strickers believe in ghosts.”
</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Peg inquired quickly, plainly puzzled to understand what the other
was planning to do with the rope.
</p>
<p>The leader gave a short laugh.
</p>
<p>“What was the name of the hermit who used to live here?” he inquired, disregarding
the question that the big one had put to him.
</p>
<p>“Anton Hackman,” I supplied, out of my knowledge of the island’s history.
</p>
<p>The rope was now untwisted into curly strands.
</p>
<p>“Take off your cap, Jerry,” the leader laughed.
</p>
<p>“What for?” I wanted to know, in growing anxiety.
</p>
<p>“Well, if you’re going to be old Anton’s ghost, you’ve got to have long scraggly hair.
For whoever heard of a hermit who shaved himself or trimmed his hair?”
</p>
<p>I backed off. For I saw into his scheme now. He was going to play ghost to scare the
Strickers <span class="pageNum" id="pb199">[<a href="#pb199">199</a>]</span>out of their camp, so that we could have the knoll to ourselves in the recovery of
the bonds.
</p>
<p>“Nothin’ doin’,” I told him firmly.
</p>
<p>Peg laughed as he grasped the leader’s proposed scheme of starting me out in a ghostly
career.
</p>
<p>“Shucks! Go ahead, Jerry. You’ll make a peachy ghost in your fancy nightshirt. It’ll
be fun, too.”
</p>
<p>“ ‘Fun’?” I repeated, giving him a stiff look. “I wouldn’t call it ‘fun’ to have a
bullet plugged into me.”
</p>
<p>“They haven’t any guns.”
</p>
<p>“Bid Stricker’s a good shot with a rock,” I came back, looking out for myself. “And
I’m not so small that he wouldn’t be able to crack me one if he half tried.”
</p>
<p>“I never heard of anybody pitching rocks at a ghost,” Peg argued.
</p>
<p>“Of course not,” Scoop put in quickly, in support of his scheme. “The proper thing
for a fellow to do when he sees a ghost,” he added, acting as though he knew it all,
“is to take to his heels and skiddo. And that’s exactly what the Strickers will do
when they get sight of you, Jerry. Honest, kid, I don’t want to envy you the fun you’re
going to have, but I’d think <i>I</i> was <span class="pageNum" id="pb200">[<a href="#pb200">200</a>]</span>pretty lucky, let me tell you, to have a ghost shirt like yours.”
</p>
<p>“To show you how unselfish I am,” I offered quickly, “I’ll trade you my nightshirt
for your pants even-up.”
</p>
<p>But he shook his head.
</p>
<p>“No, Jerry,” he refused, in put-on seriousness. “I’m your loyal chum and I would be
ashamed of myself to take advantage of you in a trade. Besides, I don’t believe that
the nightshirt would fit me. My legs aren’t shaped like yours.”
</p>
<p>I was getting hot at him for trying to crowd me into taking the risky part.
</p>
<p>“You don’t <i>want</i> it to fit you,” I flared up, holding him with my scowling eyes. “You want <i>me</i> to take <i>all</i> the risks. You’re good, you are … to yourself!”
</p>
<p>He straightway started to peel off his pants.
</p>
<p>“Shucks!” I said, feeling foolish. “I didn’t mean it. What do you want me to do?”
</p>
<p>Peg patted me on the back.
</p>
<p>“Good ol’ Pansy Blossom!” he bragged.
</p>
<div class="figure p197width"><img src="images/p197.jpg" alt="WE PROCEEDED UP THE ROCKY SLOPE TO WHERE THE ENEMY WAS IN CAMP." width="483" height="720"><div class="figAnnotation p197width"><span class="figBottomLeft"><i>Jerry Todd and the Oak Island Treasure.</i>

<p class="figureHead">WE PROCEEDED UP THE ROCKY SLOPE TO WHERE THE ENEMY WAS IN CAMP.</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>I wasn’t half as brave as he thought I was. But I had pride in wanting to appear brave.
So I let the others fix me up. The rope strands that they tucked under my cap gave
me the appearance of having hair to my shoulders. I was <span class="pageNum" id="pb201">[<a href="#pb201">201</a>]</span>a pretty-looking picture, let me tell you, when they got through with me. I was then
supplied with a crooked stick for a cane and instructed how to walk, sort of bent
over like an old man. Having memorized the piece that I was to recite, we continued
our ascent of the hill.
</p>
<p>“You better say good-by to your little Pansy Blossom,” I told the others, when we
came to the tents of the sleeping enemy. “For I have the feeling that you won’t see
Pansy whole again.”
</p>
<p>“Rats!” laughed Scoop. “You aren’t in any danger, Jerry.”
</p>
<p>“Something’s the matter with my knees,” I shivered. “They wiggle.”
</p>
<p>“Toe in and they’ll be all right.”
</p>
<p>“Maybe,” I suggested, “you fellows better come along with me and sort of prop me up
on each side.”
</p>
<p>“Forget it!”
</p>
<p>“I want to,” I returned quickly, “but you won’t let me.”
</p>
<p>“Shucks! Think of the satisfaction of being able to tell the Strickers later on that
<i>you</i> were the ‘ghost’ that put them scooting.”
</p>
<p>“They may ‘scoot’ at me,” I worried, “and knock my block off.”
</p>
<p>Well, it had to be done. So, with a sort of resigned <span class="pageNum" id="pb202">[<a href="#pb202">202</a>]</span>sigh, I got ready to do it. Arranging my rope hair so that it hung down in my eyes
I gripped my crooked cane and went across the open spot where the campfire had been
built to the big tent, which, as Peg had said, was set up directly over the place
where we had buried the bonds. Squinting inside, I saw Bid and another member of the
gang snoozing to beat the cars. His mouth open, the leader was going: “Hee-e-e-haw-w-w!
Hee-e-e-haw-w-w!” At sight of him I stiffened. What he had coming to him! Oh, mamma!
The thought of it sort of perked me up and stiffened my grit. I had had to endure
many mean tricks at his hands. But now I was to get even. I was glad.
</p>
<p>In line with Scoop’s instructions I gave a sort of graveyard groan, standing in full
view within the moonlit tent. Bid moved in his sleep. Another blood-curdling groan
brought his eyes wide open. He gave a gasp at sight of my white nightshirt and rope
hair. From the sound he made I could imagine that his heart had just gone kerplunk!
into a puddle in the pit of his stomach. Raising himself on his hands he blinked at
me, as though he couldn’t make himself believe that he really was awake.
</p>
<p>“I … am … the … ghost … of <span class="pageNum" id="pb203">[<a href="#pb203">203</a>]</span>Anton … Hackman … the … hermit,” I recited slowly, letting my voice come out of my
shoes, sort of. “I … was … murdered … on … this … spot,” I went on. “I … warn … you
… away.” Here I made a slashing motion with my pocketknife. “I … cut … initials …
on boys’ … gizzards,” I concluded.
</p>
<p>Well, I could tell from Bid’s face that there was no longer any doubt in his mind
that he was wide awake. He was seeing, so he thought, the sure-enough ghost of the
island’s dead hermit, whose story, of course, he had heard.
</p>
<p>And was he scared? I only wish you could have seen him! Oh, boy! His eyes, glassy
with horror, stuck out of his white face like halved onions.
</p>
<p>The tent’s other occupant was now awake and sitting up.
</p>
<p>“What the dickens?…” Hib Milden stared, blinking at me. Then, in better control of
his senses, he let out a ringing screech. “It’s a ghost! It’s a ghost!”
</p>
<p>Bid didn’t say anything. He couldn’t. He was scared speechless. But the use of his
arms and legs had not deserted him, as was shown when I started at him with my pocketknife.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb204">[<a href="#pb204">204</a>]</span>Backing off on all fours, like a crab, he went out of the tent under its canvas wall
and down the hill like a shot, the other kid hot on his flying heels.
</p>
<p>Their screaming voices awakened the others. A pair of bare legs was disgorged from
one pup tent; a tousled head came out of another. To an audience of five pairs of
bulging eyes I did some more reciting and knife flourishing. And it wasn’t many seconds,
let me tell you, before Bid’s trusty followers had joined their gallant leader at
the foot of the hill.
</p>
<p>At the flight of the Strickers my chums came quickly into sight. Tearing down the
big tent, to get a clearer view of the ground, they quickly located the spot where
the treasure had been buried and set to work, using a spade that they had picked up
near the campfire.
</p>
<p>Boy, I never saw faster digging in all my life! And as the others worked in the recovery
of the treasure I did a few more moonlight ghost stunts for the benefit of the scared
ones at the foot of the hill. But they were fast getting over their scare. I could
see that.
</p>
<p>Pretty soon the spade struck the brass box. In another minute the treasure was lifted
out of the ground. The Strickers were now coming up the <span class="pageNum" id="pb205">[<a href="#pb205">205</a>]</span>hill on the run. But their fast approach didn’t excite us. For in the time that it
would take them to reach the top of the hill we would be half-way to the boat.
</p>
<p>The leader had the brass box locked tightly in his arms.
</p>
<p>“Beat it, everybody!” he panted, starting down the hill on the gallop, Red and Peg
hard after him.
</p>
<p>Of no desire to make the journey from the island into Tutter in a borrowed nightshirt,
I said to myself that here was my chance to get a pair of pants. Darting to one of
the pup tents I grabbed the first pair of pants that came to my hands. I could hear
the Strickers near by. So I didn’t try to run back to the path, but jumped into the
nearest clump of hazel brush. It was shadowy here. I couldn’t see where I was putting
my feet.
</p>
<p><i>Snap!</i>
</p>
<p>I gave a terrified shriek as the awful thing, whatever it was, set its teeth into
the toe of my left shoe. The island contained some monstrous snakes. Five—six feet
long. Black fellows with hungry eyes. And on the moment all I could think of was that
I had stepped into a snake’s <span class="pageNum" id="pb206">[<a href="#pb206">206</a>]</span>nest. I expected to have a wriggling body coil itself around my captured leg. <i>Oh!…</i> I can’t begin to describe my terror and horror.
</p>
<p>But it wasn’t a snake. Instead, it was a huge snapping turtle—the same turtle, we
were told later, that Peg and Red had captured in their trip around the island. The
Strickers had picked up the big turtle in landing on the island and had tied it, by
one hind foot, to a tree near their camp.
</p>
<p>Say, at sight of that turtle I felt like a dumb-bell right. With seventeen billion
places on the island to put my foot down, I had picked out one of the very few places
where danger lurked. I was good, all right!
</p>
<p>I gave my foot a sharp wrench. But the old snapper had a death grip on the toe of
my shoe. I could imagine from his dogged conduct that the Strickers had been tantalizing
him with sticks, getting him in exactly the right frame of mind to want to chew the
piston out of a locomotive. What a piece of good luck, he probably was purring to
himself, that a nice juicy foot had finally come within snapping distance of his watering
jaws. Gr-r-r-r! Just to show me how tickled he was in the turn of his luck he tightened
down with his teeth. I gave another shriek. My toes were being crushed.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb207">[<a href="#pb207">207</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Strickers had by this time arrived in a fighting mood at the top of the hill.
I could hear them raving about the flattened tent. And realizing what would happen
to me if they got their hands on me, I whipped out my pocketknife, slashing the rope
that held the turtle to the tree. Then the two of us, the snapper and me, rolled over
and over down the hill.
</p>
<p>“It’s Jerry Todd!” I heard Bid Stricker screech. “After him, fellows,” was the leader’s
furious command.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Afterwards, when our adventure had come to an end and I was home again, with my stomach
crammed full of Mother’s grand cooking and my left foot done up in arnica bandages,
Dad asked me if I was the one who had thought up the ghost trick. I could tell from
the tone of his voice that the trick didn’t stack up very high in his estimation,
so I hastened to tell him the truth about the matter.
</p>
<p>“I rather thought it was Scoop’s work,” he grunted. “Why do you always let that crazy
kid do your thinking for you?” he followed up, “Why don’t you do your own thinking?”
</p>
<p>“He has more ideas than any of the rest of us,” I explained lamely.
</p>
<p>“Is this a sample of one of his most brilliant ideas?”
</p>
<p>I didn’t say anything.
</p>
<p>“If <i>I</i> had been your leader,” Dad proceeded, “I wouldn’t have aroused the whole camp with
a <span class="pageNum" id="pb209">[<a href="#pb209">209</a>]</span>crazy ghost trick. Instead, I would have quietly concentrated on the two kids in the
big tent.”
</p>
<p>I still didn’t say anything.
</p>
<p>“The four of you,” the speaker went on, “could have handled Bid and the other kid
without a particle of trouble, keeping them from sounding an outcry. But I don’t suppose
you ever thought of such a commonplace scheme as that.”
</p>
<p>“No,” I admitted.
</p>
<p>In looking back I can truthfully agree with Dad to the point that our ghost trick
was somewhat of a crazy mess. And the wonder to me is that it worked as well as it
did. I don’t believe that any boy could fool <i>me</i> with a shallow trick like that. Still, a fellow should be slow to brag on himself
ahead of time. For, in all truth, as I have found out from experience, it is hard
to always foretell what one is liable to do if caught unprepared. And if I had been
in Bid Stricker’s boots, so to speak, it isn’t improbable that I would have lost my
head as completely as he did.
</p>
<p>Anyway, to sum up, I have no regrets that we took the more exciting course of recovering
the buried treasure as considered against the safer course. For we had fun … up to
the point where the snapper got a whack at me. What we did that night makes better
reading, I think, than <span class="pageNum" id="pb210">[<a href="#pb210">210</a>]</span>what Dad would have done. So, as I say, with the interests of my story in mind, I
am glad that Scoop, and not the elder, was the leader.
</p>
<p>Well, as I left off in the preceding chapter, the snapper and I did a sort of spirited
loop-the-loop down the sandy side of the hill. And having successfully skinned four
noses and eleven elbows and seven ears, all of which belonged to me, we landed in
a sort of tangle at the foot of the incline.
</p>
<p>In the rough-and-tumble descent the snapper had cheerfully gagged up my leg, probably
of the opinion that life in my company was much too exciting for one of its staid
temperament. And as I sort of untwisted my arms and legs from around my neck, I was
treated to a sight of my late toe crusher stiffly retreating to the water on long
brisk legs. Its whole expression was one of outraged indignation. And I doubt not
that to this day it tells its gaping grandchildren and great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren
a pitiful story of how a sort of demonic combination of legs and arms and white nightshirt
and rope hair tried to fiendishly murder it by stomping on it and rolling on it and
stuffing its eyes full of scenery and sand burs. And in the times when I am abroad
in the canal <span class="pageNum" id="pb211">[<a href="#pb211">211</a>]</span>it isn’t improbable, in fancy, that I am the unknown target of many pairs of venomous
young-snapper eyes, whose hard-shelled clannish owners haven’t forgiven me for what
I did in cold blood to “poor old grandpop.”
</p>
<p>But I should worry about “poor old grandpop.” For he certainly did a plenty to me.
</p>
<p>As can be imagined I had made a much livelier and hence quicker descent of the hill
than Bid Stricker and his galloping followers. And having been able to keep my senses
in a bundle in the time that I was skidding through the sand burs, first on one ear
and then on the other, I wasn’t more than a handful of seconds getting to my feet
when I arrived, so to speak, at the end of the car line.
</p>
<p>Somewhere on the whirling hillside, between me and the spinning moon, the enemy was
shouting and pounding their way through the hazel brush. In view of their very determined
and businesslike actions, it plainly was important to my safety, I decided, to do
some brisk leg stretching in the direction of the rowboat.
</p>
<p>But where was the blamed boat? I had lost all sense of directions. The moon, now sensibly
quieted down, was the only thing within range of my eyes that was properly in place.
Certainly <span class="pageNum" id="pb212">[<a href="#pb212">212</a>]</span>the hill that I had just separated company with had turned itself around. I had accompanied
the snapper down the east slope, yet here I was at the foot of the west slope—or was
it the north slope? No matter, I wasn’t to be fooled. The hill had turned around and
I knew it.
</p>
<p>However, vague as I was on the points of the compass, I started off undaunted, following
my nose. But unfortunately I wasn’t quite nimble enough to escape to cover ahead of
the enemy’s lively eyes. They let out a chesty whoop at sight of me. And down the
hill they galloped faster than ever … seven lumbering, baying, brutish hounds, I bitterly
thought to myself, chasing one poor gentle fox.
</p>
<p>I was in a path now. But it wasn’t, I quickly concluded, the path leading to the boat.
It couldn’t be, I told myself steadily. For it was on the wrong side of the hill to
be the right path. Nevertheless, thinks I, it is worth penetrating. So on I went with
one good foot and what was left of the other one.
</p>
<p>Hot dog! A miracle had happened. I <i>was</i> in the right path, after all. For up ahead of me was the entrance to the hermit’s
cave.
</p>
<p>The path at this point led along a sort of ledge, with a white sandstone wall on the
right, <span class="pageNum" id="pb213">[<a href="#pb213">213</a>]</span>into which the mouth of the cave was set. To the left was a drop of possibly twenty
feet into a ravine.
</p>
<p>Coming to the narrow ledge I slowed down. For I had no wish to lose my footing and
end up in the rocky pit of the ravine. A moment later I wished with all my heart that
I <i>had</i> gone into the ravine. For what do you know if I didn’t run smack into the killer!
</p>
<p>Yes, sir, the warty-nosed piano tuner was in the cave, and when I skidded into the
picture, so to speak, he stepped out and nabbed me. I don’t mean that he was rough
about it. To the contrary, he was crammed full of oily politeness. But I wasn’t fooled
by his smooth manners. For I could see behind his shell of politeness into a twisted
mind and a blood-hungry heart.
</p>
<p>Boy, was I ever scared! I had frightened Bid Stricker with silly talk about cutting
initials on his gizzard. Now I thought to myself, in cold shivers, how about my own
gizzard?
</p>
<p>“And so,” the killer said softly, smiling into my bulging eyes with a sort of purring-cat
expression on his wicked face, “we meet again.”
</p>
<p>I didn’t say anything, for, in my scare, I had forgotten how to unhook my tongue.
</p>
<p>“I trust,” he added, still purring and feeling <span class="pageNum" id="pb214">[<a href="#pb214">214</a>]</span>of me with his mean eyes, “that you remember me.”
</p>
<p>I nodded jerkily, swallowing to keep my heart down. In trying to back up, to get as
far away from the other as I could, I pressed so hard against the cave’s white wall
that it is a wonder that the stone didn’t crack.
</p>
<p>The object of my horrified gaze sort of wound himself up for one of his long-winded
speeches.
</p>
<p>“In our other brief meeting, as I recall, I was in somewhat of—aw—frivolous talkative
mood. That undoubtedly did not escape your attention. And for fear that you might
harbor the erroneous impression, along with certain others with whom I have come in
contact, that I am a man of idle, silly words and extravagant manners, and nothing
else, I hasten, my young friend, in the interests of your continued welfare, to draw
an illustrative parallel between myself and that universally treasured pet, the seemingly
gentle house cat. The point is,” and his voice was steely now, “that even as the purring
cat has hidden claws, so also may I!”
</p>
<p>I saw what he meant. He was talking business and he wanted me to know it.
</p>
<p>Letting his hidden threat have time to sink in, he added brusquely:
<span class="pageNum" id="pb215">[<a href="#pb215">215</a>]</span></p>
<p>“You know what I want. If you’ve got it, come across with it,” and he held out his
hand, rubbing his thumb and finger tips.
</p>
<p>As I say, I was scared speechless.
</p>
<p>“Well?” he followed up sharply, with a gesture of impatience.
</p>
<p>I shook my head.
</p>
<p>“You haven’t got the money?”
</p>
<p>I gave my head another shake, shivering in the horror of his snaky touch as he quickly
felt me over to make sure that I was telling him the truth.
</p>
<p>“It embarrasses me,” he sort of hummed in his work, “to appear, in my actions, to
doubt your veracity. That, I realize, as an ardent student of the science of psychology,
is bad, very bad. However, business is business.… Who has the money?—one of your pals?”
</p>
<p>I nodded.
</p>
<p>“If I were of a prying nature,” he went on, “I might feel the impulse to press you
for an explanation of how you arrived at your knowledge of the hidden money. However,
that is neither here nor there.… I notice that you are without pants and hence without
pockets.”
</p>
<p>I nodded again.
</p>
<p>“Is this the lock tender’s nightshirt?”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb216">[<a href="#pb216">216</a>]</span></p>
<p>I answered with another nod.
</p>
<p>“Great indeed will be his perturbation when he learns that he has lost a nightshirt
as well as a piano leg and three pairs of choice bed sheets! A worthy old gentleman,
though a trifle obtuse. Still, he played a most excellent game of checkers.”
</p>
<p>At this point the Strickers tumbled into the cave, hot and panting, amazed to find
me in the company of a strange man.
</p>
<p>But Bid made short work of recovering his nervy gab.
</p>
<p>“Hey!” he panted, jabbing his finger at me. “We want him.”
</p>
<p>The killer, having eagerly searched the newcomers’ faces in the hope of finding my
churns, smiled dryly.
</p>
<p>“Who,” he inquired slowly, holding Bid’s eyes, “are ‘we’?”
</p>
<p>The leader waggled and gestured.
</p>
<p>“He tore our tent down, mister. You can come up the hill and see for yourself if you
don’t believe me. We’re camping up there. And he came up on us when we were asleep.”
</p>
<p>Jimmy Stricker got his shrill voice oiled up.
</p>
<p>“He made us think he was a ghost.”
</p>
<p>This gave the killer an explanation of my not <span class="pageNum" id="pb217">[<a href="#pb217">217</a>]</span>ordinary appearance. And his peculiar smile deepened as he looked me over.
</p>
<p>“Have you,” he inquired gravely, “been picking on these poor defenseless boys?”
</p>
<p>I nodded.
</p>
<p>“He said he was Anton Hackman’s ghost,” Jimmy put in.
</p>
<p>“And who, may I ask, is Anton Hackman?”
</p>
<p>The screechy one let out his neck in surprise.
</p>
<p>“Didn’t you ever hear of <i>him</i>?” he countered shrilly. “You know what a hermit is, don’t you? Well, he was a hermit
and he lived right here in this cave. Yes, sir, mister, he did. That was years and
years ago. Some people tell that he was murdered. Others say he just died of old age
and was ate up by the wolves. Anyway, he disappeared.”
</p>
<p>The killer, in continuation of his cat-like smile, plucked one of my few remaining
rope strands.
</p>
<p>“A not bad imitation of hair, at that,” he mused.
</p>
<p>Bid Stricker flushed.
</p>
<p>“Huh!” he grunted, humiliated in the thought of how cleverly I had fooled him.
</p>
<p>“The actions of you boys,” the killer spoke up after a moment, “would suggest to me
that you are not the warmest of friends.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb218">[<a href="#pb218">218</a>]</span></p>
<p>“I should hope not,” Bid spit out, glaring at me. “We hate him.… Let us have him,
mister,” he begged eagerly.
</p>
<p>But the killer raised a hand in my protection.
</p>
<p>“Do you happen to know,” he inquired of the gang’s leader, “if this boy’s companions
are on the island?”
</p>
<p>“Sure thing,” Bid blurted out. “We saw ’em.”
</p>
<p>The killer’s eyes snapped at this information. Gone was the purring smile now. I shivered
in the sudden change in the man. For I read his evil mind. He was going to get Scoop.
</p>
<p>“I have important business elsewhere on the island,” he told Bid quickly, “and I am
going to ask you to stay here and guard this boy until I return. However, much as
you would like to do so, I caution you <i>not</i> to lay hands on him to mistreat him. For he is <i>my</i> prisoner. Understand?… I’ll be back in a few minutes.”
</p>
<p>Bid was on fire with curiosity.
</p>
<p>“Who is he, Jerry?” he quizzed, when the killer had passed quickly from the cave.
</p>
<p>I didn’t say anything.
</p>
<p>“We can <i>make</i> you talk,” Jimmy Stricker put in.
</p>
<p>“Seven to one,” I sneered.
</p>
<p>The leader’s eyes hadn’t left my face.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb219">[<a href="#pb219">219</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Who is he?” he pressed steadily.
</p>
<p>“The King of Ireland.”
</p>
<p>“I’ll ‘king’ you,” he darkened.
</p>
<p>“Yesterday,” I said, “he was the Sultan of San Francisco.”
</p>
<p>“I’d like to punch your head,” raved Bid.
</p>
<p>Jimmy was dancing.
</p>
<p>“Go ahead; go ahead,” he urged, pushing the leader’s arm.
</p>
<p>But Bid, with an uneasy look at the cave’s entrance, shook his head.
</p>
<p>“You heard what the man said.”
</p>
<p>Jimmy is full of mean tricks.
</p>
<p>“Anyway,” he hung on, wanting to work his spite on me, “we’ve got a right, as his
guards, to tie him up,” and he came at me with a piece of rope that Scoop had left
in the cave.
</p>
<p>I tried to fight him off. I would have succeeded, too, if the others hadn’t pitched
in and helped him. I was hot, let me tell you. I had no chance against seven. And,
as I lay on the cave floor, bound hand and foot, I told myself that they’d get their
pay for this.
</p>
<p>Then, in the turn of my thoughts, I wondered what was happening outside of the cave.
Had my chums been backed into a trap by the killer? Was the money forever lost to
us? And had the <span class="pageNum" id="pb220">[<a href="#pb220">220</a>]</span>triumphant thief also made off with the bonds?
</p>
<p>I was miserable in the helplessness of my position and in our seeming defeat.
</p>
<p>As the minutes dragged along and the killer didn’t return, the Strickers became impatient.
One of them went outside to look around.
</p>
<p>“Hey, Jimmy.”
</p>
<p>“Well?”
</p>
<p>“Come out here a minute.”
</p>
<p>Bid’s cousin went outside to learn what the other wanted of him. There was an elapse
of a minute or two. Then:
</p>
<p>“Hib! Come here.”
</p>
<p>Hib Milden went out. And pretty soon <i>he</i> called to a fourth one and the fourth one to a fifth. I began to wonder, in mounting
uneasiness, what was happening out there where they were.
</p>
<p>Leaving the seventh member of the gang on guard over me, Bid himself took a look outside
to learn what had attracted his companions from the cave, one after another. And pretty
soon <i>he</i> called out:
</p>
<p>“Hey, Tom! Come here.”
</p>
<p>I was now left all alone in the cave. Two—three minutes passed as I struggled with
my bonds. Then a chuckle penetrated my anxious ears. It was Peg!
<span class="pageNum" id="pb221">[<a href="#pb221">221</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Hi, Jerry,” old hefty grinned, coming into the cave. Whipping out his pocketknife
he cut my bonds.
</p>
<p>I got quickly to my feet.
</p>
<p>“The Strickers are outside!” I cried in warning, expecting any moment to have the
enemy rush into the cave.
</p>
<p>Peg gave an easy laugh.
</p>
<p>“Sure thing the Strickers are outside. Red and I have been having the fun of our lives
roping and gagging them, one after another. Crickets, Jerry, I wish you could have
been in on it! Red called them out and I took them in hand and held them while he
put on the ropes and gags. Teamwork, eh?”
</p>
<p>Here freckle-face strutted into the cave.
</p>
<p>“Did Peg tell you?” he grinned at me.
</p>
<p>I nodded, sort of dizzy in the whirl of things.
</p>
<p>“Where’s Scoop?” I gasped, mindful all of a sudden of our leader’s absence.
</p>
<p>“Collecting,” Peg said broadly, grinning.
</p>
<p>“ ‘Collecting’?” I repeated, staring at him. “Collecting what?”
</p>
<p>“Rowboats,” he added, in the same broad way.
</p>
<p>I didn’t understand.
</p>
<p>“It wouldn’t do us any good to escape from the island,” he explained, “if we left
a boat behind. <span class="pageNum" id="pb222">[<a href="#pb222">222</a>]</span>For the killer would then take after us.”
</p>
<p>“You’ve seen him?” I cried.
</p>
<p>“Sure thing,” Red put in.
</p>
<p>“We saw him land in his boat,” Peg picked up. “And, as you hadn’t come into sight,
Red and I followed him, to help you in case he tackled you. We saw him switch you
into the cave. And we would have rushed to your rescue if the Strickers hadn’t come
into sight. While we were debating what to do, the man came out of the cave and disappeared
in the direction of his boat. Now was our chance, we said. And we got busy.”
</p>
<p>“Guess we worked it pretty slick, hey?” Red bragged on himself.
</p>
<p>“I’ll tell the world you did,” I cried. “But let’s get out of here,” I added quickly.
“For the killer is liable to be back at any moment.”
</p>
<p>Outside I was treated to a sight of the enemy, each one gagged with his own handkerchief
and tied, wrists and ankles, with the ropes of the flattened tent.
</p>
<p>“How do you like it?” I purred, looking down at Bid in warm triumph.
</p>
<p>“Um-m-m-m-m!” he returned, chewing his gag.
</p>
<p>“Untie the handkerchiefs,” Peg directed, starting to work. “For we should worry how
loud they yell now. Our work’s done.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb223">[<a href="#pb223">223</a>]</span></p>
<p>While he and Red removed the gags I ran up the hill. For it had come to me suddenly
that I had dropped my borrowed pants at the spot where the turtle had nabbed me.
</p>
<p>“I don’t know whose pants they are,” I told the Strickers upon my return, “but here’s
a nightshirt for the unlucky one. So long, Biddie ol’ dear! The next time you see
a ghost you want to talk pretty to it and then it won’t harm you.”
</p>
<p>Well, we scooted in the direction of the south shore, where it had been arranged that
the leader was to wait for us with his collection of rowboats. On the way to the water
I more than half expected to have the killer jump on us. But we saw nothing of him.
Nor have we, for that matter, seen anything of him to this day. The Strickers tell
the story that he came back to the cave, setting them free. Then he vanished. And
it was well for him, I might add, that he did vanish. For the law was on the lookout
for him the following day.
</p>
<p>Scoop, in waiting for us off shore, had a string of four rowboats, the girl’s, which
he and its owner were in, the Strickers’ two and the killer’s one, which we learned
later was the lock tender’s. Anchoring the three towed boats a thousand feet <span class="pageNum" id="pb224">[<a href="#pb224">224</a>]</span>or so from the island, where they would be discovered in the daylight, we started
for home.
</p>
<p>Coming to the channel we heard, behind us, the echoing beat of a gasoline engine.
A boat was coming down the canal from the direction of the lock where we had been
held prisoners. At first we detected nothing distinctive in the engine’s sounds. But
it wasn’t many seconds before our red-headed engineer tumbled to the truth of the
matter.
</p>
<p>“It’s the <i>Sally Ann</i>!” he yipped, crazy.
</p>
<p>The <i>Sally Ann</i>! Peg and I and Scoop stared at one another in stupefaction. It couldn’t be our boat,
we said.
</p>
<p>But it was.
</p>
<p>We waited, in trembling suspense, until the scow overtook us. At sight of the tillerman
I gave a gasp. The white-haired thief! The man who had tried to murder his wealthy
brother!
</p>
<p>Was <i>he</i> the “friendly ghost”?
</p>
<p>“Grandfather!” the girl cried, standing up in the rowboat and stretching out her hands
to the aged man at the tiller. “Grandfather!”

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE MYSTERY CLEARS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">My story, in a way, really ends at this point, for we had no further adventures between
the big wide waters and home.
</p>
<p>Tired as we were, we experienced a lively thrill at sight of the grain elevator and
the other towering landmarks in our home town. A number of people came running to
the canal dock when they heard our organ, which we had switched on to triumphantly
announce the arrival of the conquering heroes, so to speak.
</p>
<p>After all of the very brave things that I had done, it wouldn’t have been displeasing
to me if the town band had turned out to welcome me, sort of. I had already made up
my mind that I wouldn’t try to keep my name out of the Tutter newspaper.
</p>
<p>Dad was one of the first ones to arrive at the dock when we drew up. As can be imagined
he got his eyes on my bandaged foot right away. And when I had told him what had happened
to <span class="pageNum" id="pb226">[<a href="#pb226">226</a>]</span>me, he rushed me up town to Doc Leland’s office, where an X-ray picture was taken
of the injured part, to learn if any bones had been broken. An hour later, when Mother
was washing hard on my ears, old Doc telephoned to the house that the bones were all
right; my foot would be as good as ever, he predicted, in a few days.
</p>
<p>Well, I wish you could have seen the amazement pictured in my parents’ faces when
I dragged my roll of money out of my pocket and told them the complete story of our
exciting adventure.
</p>
<p>“A ‘friendly ghost,’ ” Dad laughed, in the conclusion of my recital. “You didn’t think
it was a real ghost, did you?”
</p>
<p>“Well,” I admitted, sort of sheepish, “I did at the start.”
</p>
<p>“There is no such thing as a ghost.”
</p>
<p>“I know that,” I waggled. “But just the same, if I were to meet a white thing in a
dark cemetery, and it jumped at me, I’d run it an awful foot race.”
</p>
<p>“The fear of ghosts, even as no such thing exists, is born in people,” Mother spoke
up, finishing one ear and starting in on the other one. “So I can imagine just how
Jerry felt.… Quit jerking your head!”
</p>
<p>“Mr. Garber has an awfully queer voice,” I <span class="pageNum" id="pb227">[<a href="#pb227">227</a>]</span>went on, blinking to keep the soapy wash rag out of my eyes. “He sort of talks out
of his shoes. So it isn’t to be wondered at that we mistook him for a whispering ghost.
Even when I knew he wasn’t a ghost, I sort of shivered to hear him talk.”
</p>
<p>There was a thoughtful look on Dad’s face.
</p>
<p>“I’ve often seen your old gentleman rowing up and down the canal. I wondered who he
was.”
</p>
<p>“He isn’t quite right,” I said, tapping the side of my head.
</p>
<p>Mother drew a sharp breath.
</p>
<p>“I should think not!” she put in quickly, screwing the wash rag into my ear. “The
idea of sending a twelve-year-old girl on an errand such as that! The poor child!
The wonder to me is that she wasn’t frightened out of her senses.”
</p>
<p>I grinned.
</p>
<p>“Mr. Garber wants me to come over and see him when my foot gets well.”
</p>
<p>“I’ll feel safer if you keep away from him.”
</p>
<p>“He’s a nice old gentleman,” I defended, “even if he is kind of queer, with a graveyard
voice. Besides,” and here I winked at Dad under the flipping end of the wash rag,
“the invitation comes from Lizzie, too.”
</p>
<p>“Nonsense!” Mother sputtered, picking at a <span class="pageNum" id="pb228">[<a href="#pb228">228</a>]</span>spot on the back of my neck with her finger nail.
</p>
<p>“Tell me again,” Dad said, “about the ‘friendly ghost.’ I didn’t quite catch on from
your story how the old gentleman worked it.”
</p>
<p>I complied, explaining how Mr. Garber had been in Tutter on business the afternoon
when we had chased the Strickers away from our boat. Starting for home in the evening,
in his rowboat, he had been driven under the bridge by the storm. The rowboat had
contained a white oilcloth, used in rainy weather, to keep the boat dry, and he had
wrapped this about his shoulders like a shawl. Coming to our scow he had heard the
Strickers on board telling how they were going to smash up our stuff. Having seen
us hard at work that afternoon, and realizing how we would feel in the loss of our
stuff, he had boarded the scow from the canal to drive the others away. With his dripping
white hair and white shawl he had looked not unlike a ghost, and at sight of him the
Strickers had run away in fright. The following day, on another rowboat trip to Tutter,
he had overheard us talking about him, calling him the “friendly ghost,” so, when
given another chance to help us, having detected the Strickers’ rope, he had signed
the note in fun with the name that we had given him.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb229">[<a href="#pb229">229</a>]</span></p>
<p>Dad laughed at the conclusion of my long explanation.
</p>
<p>“<i>Some</i> adventure, I’ll tell the world!”
</p>
<p>Well, to wind up my story, I will further explain that the girl’s grandfather and
uncle were twin brothers, so much alike in appearance that the gardener never had
suspected that the injured man that he had found in a pool of blood on the kitchen
floor was his employer’s brother, struck down by his evil companion, and not the retired
banker, himself. Nor had the police suspected the truth of the matter. As for us,
never having seen the grandfather to know him, it wasn’t surprising, in the moment
of his appearance in charge of the scow, that we had mistaken him for the other man.
</p>
<p>But the girl knew that the tillerman was her grandfather and not her uncle. And you
should have seen the way she flew into the old gentleman’s arms when we boarded the
big boat.
</p>
<p>The story that the unnerved grandparent gave us in his emotional reunion with the
younger relative was rather vague and sketchy. And to this day I don’t know whether,
in his wild flight from the log house, he knew that his brother had been struck down
or not. However, that is not an important point.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb230">[<a href="#pb230">230</a>]</span></p>
<p>Coming to the big wide waters shortly after we had rowed to shore with the brass box,
he had seen our swinging lantern climb to the island’s summit. Frightened to a point
of collapse in his advanced age by the night’s preceding events, he was now further
unnerved by our presence on the island. The crazy idea came to him that we had <i>dug up</i> the bonds that the granddaughter (so he thought) had earlier buried. And to be near
the bonds, with a view of secretly recovering them, he had hid on our boat, under
the rear deck, and was there in the time of our trip into Steam Corners and back to
the lock.
</p>
<p>It was his drifting rowboat that Scoop and I had seen that morning when we went to
the <i>Sally Ann</i> to get the stuff for breakfast. Further, it was the old gentleman’s footfalls that
we had heard in our approach of the scow. And now that it is known that he was hidden
under the deck where our food was kept, the mystery of the vanished ham is explained.
</p>
<p>Lizzie had told us that her rascally uncle, on another visit to his wealthy brother’s
home, had stolen a lot of the latter’s money. In fear of being caught with the money
the thief had hidden it in a hollow leg of his brother’s old-fashioned piano, intending
to return for the greenbacks later <span class="pageNum" id="pb231">[<a href="#pb231">231</a>]</span>on. And we know that he <i>did</i> return for the money, after an elapse of nearly three years, bringing with him a
man as evil-minded as himself. Whether or not the piano tuner knew of the money’s
exact hiding place before coming to the log house never will be known to us. For the
uncle kept a still tongue in his scheming head in the time that he was in the hospital;
and as soon as he was discharged he quickly disappeared. But I have always held to
the thought that the piano tuner found out about the money’s hiding place that night
in the kitchen. That may have been the cause of his attack on the other—his decision,
I mean, to recover the money himself. However, <i>we</i> got to the piano ahead of either of the two law breakers, as I have related. And
the money was properly turned over to its rightful owner.
</p>
<p>In refurnishing his summer home, shortly after the theft and the subsequent secretion
of the greenbacks, the banker had sold his old-fashioned piano to his gardener; and
later the gardener had been appointed to the position of tender at the Steam Corners
lock.
</p>
<p>Well acquainted with the lock tender, the banker, in a return of his main senses,
had settled for the destroyed sheets, thereby gaining the release of our show boat,
in which he had started <span class="pageNum" id="pb232">[<a href="#pb232">232</a>]</span>for the island. How we had met him in the channel I already have described.
</p>
<p>He had secured the “release” of my pants, too, as well as the show boat. And when
I ran my hands into the pockets, there was our show money and my own eight dollars.
Not a penny missing.
</p>
<p>In Ashton we had a long talk with the mayor about the greased-pig trick. And when
he learned that the policeman had been playing poker, when he should have been in
the street on duty, it was mister blue jacket who got into trouble, let me tell you,
and not us.
</p>
<p>We hesitated to accept the two-hundred-dollar reward; for we didn’t want the girl
to think that we had helped her in the thought of getting pay for our work. But the
mayor said firmly that we <i>had</i> to take the money—the reward had been publicly posted, he explained, and consequently
had to be paid. So we took it.
</p>
<p>Back in Tutter again, we gave a sort of jubilee performance on the first night of
our return, only I wasn’t of much help with my lame foot. We took in nine dollars
and sixty cents. Everybody admitted that we had been very brave and Mr. Stair coaxed
me to let him put my name in his newspaper. One of the big Chicago newspapers told
about me, too, in eight or ten lines. It was <span class="pageNum" id="pb233">[<a href="#pb233">233</a>]</span>very pleasing to me to read about myself. The other fellows were mentioned in the
article.
</p>
<p>Following the jubilee performance I made out a report of our show business, which
showed how much money had been taken in and how much had been paid out. Here is a
copy of the report:

<p>You can see from these figures that our boat show was a big success. And we are not
without hope that some day our parents will let us start out again.
</p>
<p>Mother declares, though, that if we <i>do</i> revive our boat show that she is going to make it her business to go along with me
with a wash rag and a cake of toilet soap.
</p>
<p>She never will get over telling the neighbors, I guess, what dirty ears I came home

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
